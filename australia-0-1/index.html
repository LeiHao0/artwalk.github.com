<p>🌞</p>
<p>These are all the thoughts of LittleMaster.</p>
<p>It was raining. After two steps, LittleMaster arrived at the port. He checked in first and found out that he was too early and had to wait for an hour before boarding the ship.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-07.avif"></p>
<p>While waiting, it started raining ☔️. LittleMaster, who wore shorts according to yesterday’s temperature 🌡️, shivered in the cold. He even considered going back to the hotel to get a thick coat 👔.</p>
<p>After boarding the ship, a broadcast 📢 announced that the waves 🌊 would be larger today and that everyone would definitely get seasick. The medication 💊 was available at the front desk, and you could buy and take it now. LittleMaster didn’t take it seriously and thought it was just a sales pitch, so he decided not to buy it.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-08.avif"></p>
<p>Then ❤️Sunlover set off.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-10.avif"></p>
<p>LittleMaster had only been on a ship once before 🚢. That ship had 7 floors, it was huge, and there were no significant waves in the Mediterranean Sea. But this was different, in the Pacific Ocean, the ship was smaller and swayed heavily. However, LittleMaster thought the swaying was quite fun.</p>
<p>Then LittleMaster noticed that all the crew members were holding a stack of papers, looking serious, but he couldn’t understand why.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone collapsed, and a crew member quickly rushed over with a paper 📄.</p>
<p>It turned out that the paper bag could be opened. The person started vomiting 🤮.</p>
<p>LittleMaster was stunned 🤯. So this was what seasickness was like. Then one after another, the tourists on the ship started laying down.</p>
<p>LittleMaster wasn’t seasick at all, even though he had taken many steps to prevent it. He thought it was very strange.</p>
<p>In the end, from Emerald Island to the edge of Moor Reef, the ship was filled with a smell of vomit 🤮, and LittleMaster also started feeling a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>They should have taken a helicopter 🚁 here and a ship 🚢 back. These people were already dead, and there were still people joining the deep-sea dive, they really didn’t value their lives. That’s what LittleMaster thought.</p>
<p>And what surprised LittleMaster even more was that after Sunlover arrived at the Pontoon platform and parked, all these “dead” people suddenly stood up one after another, as if they hadn’t been vomiting 🤮 just now.</p>
<p>LittleMaster was shocked and even asked one or two passersby, who said that as long as there was no swaying, they would immediately feel better!</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-15.avif"></p>
<p>Looking at these 🌊, go down from here? Are you kidding?</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-11.avif"></p>
<p>Then, many people didn’t even have dinner. They put on their equipment and went into the sea. Some even let go of their life jackets.</p>
<hr>
<p>After drifting for a long time, they still didn’t understand how to move forward. LittleMaster, who usually pressed W to move forward in games, saw many 🐟.</p>
<p>A local guide said that it wasn’t usually like this. The sun would shine brightly, unlike now, where you couldn’t see anything, and the waves 🌊 were so big, it was terrifying. So that’s why. LittleMaster understood 😌 and thought he would come back another time to see it.</p>
<p>He returned 10 minutes early for dinner and found that all the delicious food had been eaten. LittleMaster managed to find some leftovers and was ready to go for a second helping, but found that the food stalls had already closed. When he went back to the ship to prepare for diving, he suddenly remembered the glass bottom boat. Oh my, LittleMaster regretted forgetting about it. Looking at his watch ⌚️, he realized there was only an hour left.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the submarine returned, many people got off. The female crew member told LittleMaster that at least two people were needed to operate the boat. LittleMaster shouted on the platform, but to his surprise, not a single person came. When he went back to tell LittleMaster, she apologized and said the boat was for 40 people, and it was too…</p>
<p>Then she asked LittleMaster if he had been on the glass bottom boat.</p>
<p>LittleMaster went up to ask if he could still go up now. The girl said all he needed to do was talk to the pilot 👨‍✈️. She also kindly gave LittleMaster a blanket for warmth, just like the one given to the victims at the crime scene in the movies.</p>
<p>The captain introduced the route, but unfortunately, LittleMaster didn’t understand much.</p>
<p>The diving spot was only 1m deep, with over 400 species of coral, some of which had been growing for 1000 years and are considered living fossils. LittleMaster also saw a giant clam with a pearl inside.</p>
<hr>
<p>After coming back by helicopter 🚁</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-13.avif"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-14.avif"></p>
<p>In the past, when LittleMaster played GTA, he couldn’t control the height well and often ended up on the road, crashing frequently.</p>
<p>As he was thinking about it, LittleMaster suddenly soared into the sky.<br>He really flew up suddenly, and the process of ascending to the sky 🔝 was much faster than LittleMaster had imagined. It was even faster than pressing W 🔝. Then LittleMaster noticed that the pilot was playing with his phone 📱.</p>
<p>In the second half of the Great Barrier Reef, the sun came out, and LittleMaster looked at the reef. This natural heritage that would disappear in 2020 suddenly reminded him of a poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clouds rise from the plain ground, unable to find peace, searching for a match in high places</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never mind the match; everyone around is in pairs, and LittleMaster is alone, which emphasizes his loneliness even more.</p>
<p>The sun came out, and now the surface of the water was probably calm.<br>The helicopter 🚁 was scheduled to leave 1.30 hours early, so there was no time for snorkeling or fish feeding.<br>Not happy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the pilot made a sharp turn.</p>
<p>Along the way, they saw Jade Island, which was highly recommended by an older gentleman.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-16.avif"></p>
<p>When they were close to Cairns, the pilot tilted the helicopter forward by 5 degrees.<br>In that moment of weightlessness, LittleMaster was very frightened 😨.</p>
<p>Then LittleMaster noticed the airport ✈️ they passed earlier. Wouldn’t it affect ✈️🛫️🛬️? Then the helicopter hovered over the grass for a while and landed in the H parking spot in front.</p>
<p>After getting off, LittleMaster shivered and ran far away from the propellers. He noticed that the staff told him to go back.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/au-0-0-18.avif"></p>
<p>After this flight, LittleMaster felt worried about the hot air balloon ride tomorrow.</p>
<hr>
<p>After returning and taking a shower 🚿, LittleMaster went to the supermarket at night 🌃 to buy things.</p>
<p>Hey, even if you’re good at English, don’t speak so fast.<br>LittleMaster can’t understand if you speak too quickly, ahhhhh.</p>
