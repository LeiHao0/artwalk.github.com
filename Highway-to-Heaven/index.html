    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the Victorian era, the greatest writer in England, Charles Dickens, once said in “A Tale of Two Cities”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,<br>it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,<br>it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,<br>it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,<br>it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,<br>we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,<br>we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way</p>
</blockquote>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Of course, this passage has little to do with this article</p>
<p>The reason for quoting here is that these sentences are eloquent and sensational</p>
<p>But LittleMaster did indeed set off and went straight to Heaven</p>
<p>It is truly amazing how rapidly the Heavenly Empire has developed. Two years ago, when LittleMaster went to Heaven from two pieces of fat paper, there was only the K series</p>
<p>Actually, the G series existed at that time, but it was like Dante’s “Divine Comedy”, with the route divided into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inferno - Purgatorio - Paradiso</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before going to Heaven, LittleMaster had to visit the Magic City first. Let’s not talk about the increased price, but in terms of time, it could even be &gt;= K series</p>
<p>One time when returning to the city, in order to save money, a friend bought a hard seat and successfully persuaded LittleMaster to join the club</p>
<p>Originally, LittleMaster was too diligent in practicing magic in the Mage Academy, which caused a minor problem with his lumbar spine</p>
<p>As a result, during the 6-hour continuous bumps, LittleMaster’s frail waist was almost broken. Since then, LittleMaster vowed to only go lying down as long as there are tickets</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a year later, the direct G series was introduced, quiet, fast, clean, and with a travel time reduced to 2.5 hours</p>
<p>However, even so, it is still quite boring on the train</p>
<p>In the past, LittleMaster would bring a book or read directly on the phone, but this time with the coding artifact, it’s naturally a whole different experience</p>
<p>But LittleMaster still had some concerns and hesitated about whether to bring out the artifact, after all, the surrounding were just common magic artifacts, like the Wandering Plague</p>
<p>Actually, LittleMaster had used and regularly used this kind of ordinary magic artifact before, from the ancient Achevedo Deadskin to the latest model, the Wandering Plague, accompanying LittleMaster for over 1,000 days and nights</p>
<p>Those were truly wonderful memories, and it was also when LittleMaster’s waist started to tire. There will be a chance to talk about it later</p>
<p>However, LittleMaster’s worries were completely unnecessary because:</p>
<p>In the eyes of LittleMaster:</p>
<p>Wow, such a young age and already got hold of an artifact, this guy is extraordinary</p>
<p>In the eyes of others:</p>
<p>A struggling code laborer, still debugging on the train</p>
<hr>
<p>Tips:</p>
<p>There’s an experiment:</p>
<p>Let others take a look at your belongings to reduce the chance of being stolen</p>
<p>Not sure if it’s true or not, but LittleMaster often uses it</p>
<p>The bystanders are also very helpful and there has been no black swan incidents so far</p>
<hr>
<p>Previously, LittleMaster asked a friend to find a farmer’s house in the community where he was staying, as a temporary transition for a month</p>
<p>Then he learned about the struggles of the Ant Tribe and the Northern Drifters</p>
<p>The environment…</p>
<p>The noise…</p>
<p>The smell…</p>
<p>In addition, the storefronts here, as if agreed upon, closed one after another, making loud noises every time, giving LittleMaster continuous and relentless stimulation</p>
<p>One after another, even more than the snoring in the dormitory where LittleMaster used to stay</p>
<p>When it was finally 3 a.m., the last storefront finally closed</p>
<p>LittleMaster thought he could finally sleep this time</p>
<p>Just as he laid down, he heard loud noises again. LittleMaster was amazed to find out that the breakfast shops were starting to open one by one</p>
<hr>
<p>LittleMaster had planned to stay calm. He thought that he had read so many books in the past year that one month would be more than enough</p>
<p>If only he had seen the documentary series, “Why Poverty?”, produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR), and specifically the eighth episode entitled “The Poor and Their Books”, he would not be so naive</p>
<p>Sure enough, after multiple applications, the results after a few days were not pleasing</p>
<p>Only received two interview calls, with a conversion rate of less than 20%, and the one interviewed has failed</p>
<p>This failed interviewee even criticized LittleMaster as unskilled, lacking advantages, introverted, and having empty-thinking, most importantly, criticized his lack of spellcasting skills</p>
<p>While feeling sad, LittleMaster skipped dinner and silently returned to the farmer’s house, and began flipping through Laozi’s “Tao Te Ching” again</p>
<p>Repeatedly using the line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Misfortune is what fortune depends upon, fortune is where misfortune hides within</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to console himself</p>
<p>╮(╯_╰)╭</p>
