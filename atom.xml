    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This</em> <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/guide/python-vs-java/"><em>article</em></a> <em>originally appeared on</em> <a href="https://junilearning.com/"><em>junilearning.com</em></a></p><h1 id="Python-vs-Java-Uses-Performance-Learning"><a href="#Python-vs-Java-Uses-Performance-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Python vs. Java: Uses, Performance, Learning"></a>Python vs. Java: Uses, Performance, Learning</h1><p>In the world of computer science, there are many programming languages, and no single language is superior to another. In other words, <strong>each language is best suited to solve certain problems</strong>, and in fact there is often no one best language to choose for a given programming project. For this reason, it is important for students who wish to develop software or to solve interesting problems through code to have <strong>strong computer science fundamentals that will apply across any programming language</strong>.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Programming languages tend to share certain characteristics in how they function, for example in the way they deal with memory usage or how heavily they use objects. Students will start seeing these patterns as they are exposed to more languages. This article will focus primarily on Python versus Java, which are two of the most widely used programming languages in the world. While it is hard to measure exactly the rate at which each programming language is growing, <strong>these are two of the most popular programming languages used in industry today</strong>.</p><p>One major difference between Python and Java is that Python is <strong>dynamically typed</strong>, while Java is <strong>statically typed</strong>. Loosely, this means that Java is much more strict about how variables are defined and used in code. <strong>As a result, Java tends to be more verbose in its syntax, which is one of the reasons we recommend learning Python before Java for beginners.</strong> For example, here is how you would create a variable named <code>numbers</code> that holds the numbers 0 through 9 in Python:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">numbers = []</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">10</span>):</span><br><span class="line">numbers.append(i)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here’s how you would do the same thing in Java:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ArrayList numbers = <span class="keyword">new</span> ArrayList();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">int</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="number">10</span>; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    numbers.add(i);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Another major difference is that Java generally runs programs more quickly than Python, as it is a <strong>compiled language</strong>. This means that before a program is actually run, the compiler translates the Java code into machine-level code. By contrast, Python is an <strong>interpreted</strong> language, meaning there is no compile step.</p><h2 id="Usage-and-Practicality"><a href="#Usage-and-Practicality" class="headerlink" title="Usage and Practicality"></a>Usage and Practicality</h2><p>Historically, Java has been the more popular language in part due to its lengthy legacy. However, Python is rapidly gaining ground. According to <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">Github’s State of the Octoberst Report</a>, it has recently surpassed Java as the most widely used programming language. As per the 2018 developer survey, <strong>Python is now the fastest-growing computer programing language</strong>.</p><p>Both Python and Java have large communities of developers to answer questions on websites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. As you can see from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python%2Cjava">Stack Overflow trends</a>, <strong>Python surpassed Java in terms the percentage of questions asked about it on Stack Overflow in 2017</strong>. At the time of writing, about 13% of the questions on Stack Overflow are tagged with Python, while about 8% are tagged with Java!</p><h2 id="Web-Development"><a href="#Web-Development" class="headerlink" title="Web Development"></a>Web Development</h2><p><strong>Python and Java can both be used for backend web development</strong>. Typically developers will use the <a href="https://stackify.com/python-frameworks/">Django and Flask</a> frameworks for Python and <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> for Java. Python is known for its code readability, meaning Python code is clean, readable, and concise. Python also has a large, comprehensive set of modules, packages, and libraries that exist beyond its standard library, developed by the community of Python enthusiasts. Java has a similar ecosystem, although perhaps to a lesser extent.</p><h2 id="Mobile-App-Development"><a href="#Mobile-App-Development" class="headerlink" title="Mobile App Development"></a>Mobile App Development</h2><p><strong>In terms of mobile app development, Java dominates the field</strong>, as it is the primary langauge used for building Android apps and games. Thanks to the aforementioned tailored libraries, developers have the option to write Android apps by leveraging robust frameworks and development tools built specifically for the operating system. Currently, Python is not used commonly for mobile development, although there are tools like <a href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a>and <a href="https://beeware.org/">BeeWare</a> that allow you to write code once and deploy apps across Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android.</p><h2 id="Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data"><a href="#Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data" class="headerlink" title="Machine Learning and Big Data"></a>Machine Learning and Big Data</h2><p>Conversely, in the world of machine learning and <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/coding-and-data-science">data science</a>, Python is the most popular language. Python is often used for big data, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence (A.I.) projects. <strong>The vast majority of data scientists and machine learning programmers opt for Python over Java while working on projects that involve sentiment analysis</strong>. At the same time, it is important to note that many machine learning programmers may choose to use Java while they work on projects related to network security, cyber attack prevention, and fraud detection.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Start"><a href="#Where-to-Start" class="headerlink" title="Where to Start"></a>Where to Start</h2><p>When it comes to learning the foundations of programming, <strong>many studies have concluded that it is easier to <a href="https://junilearning.com/coding">learn Python</a> over Java</strong>, due to Python’s simple and intuitive syntax, as seen in the earlier example. Java programs often have more boilerplate code - sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration - than Python. That being said, there are some notable advantages to Java, in particular its speed as a compiled language. <strong>Learning both Python and Java will give students exposure to two languages that lay their foundation on similar computer science concepts, yet differ in educational ways.</strong></p><p>Overall, it is clear that both Python and Java are powerful programming languages in practice, and it would be advisable for any aspiring software developer to learn both languages proficiently. Programmers should compare Python and Java based on the specific needs of each software development project, as opposed to simply learning the one language that they prefer. In short, <strong>neither language is superior to another, and programmers should aim to have both in their coding experience</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Python</th><th>Java</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Runtime Performance</td><td></td><td>Winner</td></tr><tr><td>Ease of Learning</td><td>Winner</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Practical Agility</td><td>Tie</td><td>Tie</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile App Development</td><td></td><td>Winner</td></tr><tr><td>Big Data</td><td>Winner</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><hr>]]></content>

In other words, &lt;strong&gt;each language is best suited to solve certain problems&lt;/strong&gt;, and in fact there is often no one best language to choose for a given programming project. For this reason, it is important for students who wish to develop software or to solve interesting problems through code to have &lt;strong&gt;strong computer science fundamentals that will apply across any programming language&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I finished the last page in the gazebo in my garden, holding back tears while writing. Only at that moment, I understood why I didn’t write this book when I was a father. Because before creating, I have to accompany my children through their growth process, nurture them, love them, and finally learn to let go</p></blockquote><hr><p>In addition, it’s hard to get involved in the reading process<br>The whole book has always given me the feeling of a Harry Potter copy</p><p>But there is a significant difference in this reading<br>In the past, when reading such novels, I often entered the book from the perspective of the protagonist<br>With age<br>This time it’s more from Silas’ perspective</p><p>If this book is a common fantasy routine in China<br>Bod will definitely pick up sister Scarlett, tame Sleer, become Master, tear Jack, sit as Brotherhood boss</p><p>However, all this did not happen in Neil, who wrote about the American Gods.<br>After Bod played the monster 👾, the sister paper was scared off, and Bod is just an ordinary <strong>The world is so big, I want to see</strong></p><p>As a father, do you want to see your Bod become the one in the country or the one in the book 📖?</p><hr><p>There are also some stupid things done during the rebellious period that require parents to pay for it<br>Now that I’m older, I understand the difficulties of my parents’ various prohibitions.</p><p>But I can’t help thinking about it<br>I didn’t know what I knew now</p><p>I have imagined that if the self now and the self then<br>I would definitely not be obedient at that time<br>You must be hammered in the face by the iron fist of society to wake up<br>Do something resolutely</p><hr><p>After dealing with the general affairs, one day he will step out of the fairy tale world and enter life</p><blockquote><p>“Good-bye, then, Silas.” Bod held out his hand, as he had when he was a small boy, and Silas took it, in a cold hand the color of old ivory, and shook it gravely.<br>“Good-bye, Nobody Owens.”<br>Bod picked up the little suitcase. He opened the door to let himself out of the crypt, walked back up the gentle slope to the path without looking back.”</p></blockquote><p>I was miserable when I came out, no one gave me away, no goodbye<br>The rent in Beijing was refunded and I bought a one-way ticket<br>All the belongings are packed in three suitcases<br>Take a taxi to the airport at 4 in the morning<br>After finishing the consignment, boarding, and then leaving</p><blockquote><p>without looking back</p></blockquote><p>How I wish I also heard Bod’s auditory hallucinations:</p><blockquote><p>He took a step forward … a voice said, “I am so proud of you, my son.”</p></blockquote>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;When I gallery videos in Photos, it will show where and when did I take them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a wonderful feature to help me to recall my memory&lt;br&gt;But the original 4k takes too much space in iCloud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a 2:30 video will take 1GB, even powered by HEVC (High-Efficiency Video Coding)&lt;br&gt;My 200G iCloud plan almost full&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m planning to compress videos a little bit to save some space.&lt;/p&gt;
