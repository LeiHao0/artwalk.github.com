<h2 id="Lottery"><a href="#Lottery" class="headerlink" title="Lottery"></a>Lottery</h2><p>In 15 years, LittleMaster wrote Swift for more than a year and was told to watch the WWDC session.<br>Without knowing what WWDC was, he looked it up and clicked on a section.<br>Surprisingly, even though he didn’t understand English, he could somewhat grasp it through guesswork.<br>Reflecting on the confusion he experienced while learning Android tutorials in the past, he found this experience to be enlightening.<br>So he went through most of the videos from that year, and benefited a lot.</p>
<p>Later he learned that as long as he had a developer account and a Visa/Mastercard credit card, he could participate in the lottery.<br>Registration for WWDC begins in early March each year on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">official website</a> and lasts only one week, so don’t miss it.</p>
<p>Due to the large number of participants, Apple randomly selects lucky (company reimbursed) or unlucky (self-funded) individuals to receive a $10,000 ticket 🎫.<br>Regardless of whether you attend or not, the payment is deducted in advance.<br>Regardless of visa rejection or refusal of entry, the money is non-refundable.<br>Tickets cannot be transferred, but can only be given to other developers within the same company.<br>In short, if you win the lottery, don’t expect a refund, so think carefully before entering.</p>
<p>However, luck has never been on his side, so he signed up without hesitation.</p>
<h2 id="Winning"><a href="#Winning" class="headerlink" title="Winning"></a>Winning</h2><p>The lottery results were announced around the end of March.</p>
<p>Late at night, he suddenly received a text message from China Merchants Bank deducting $1599 and a phone call from a suspected card theft incident.<br>He quickly proved his identity to the bank.<br>The next day, he woke up to a confirmation email.<br>He quickly called his friends and was told to prepare for visa and hotel arrangements.</p>
<p>Apple provides some hotels near the conference venue, but the prices were quite high, with the cheapest being $229 per night.<br>Considering that he was alone, he decided to book a nearby Airbnb.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a colleague who didn’t win the lottery still wanted to attend.<br>In addition, he had two friends who could fly from Canada 🇨🇦 and the United States 🇺🇸 to San Francisco to have fun.</p>
<p>So he cancelled the hotel reservation and booked an Airbnb that looked good.</p>
<p>And his friend could drive, so he rented a car from Herz.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>

<h2 id="Visa"><a href="#Visa" class="headerlink" title="Visa"></a>Visa</h2><p>First, he needed a passport.<br>Unlike those who arrive overseas just after getting off the plane, he had never been anywhere before and owned a blank passport.<br>Luckily, when he went back to his hometown in 15 years to visit his parents, he got it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he made an appointment on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ustraveldocs.com/cn_zh/index.html">official website</a> for a visa interview.<br>He paid online and scheduled the interview time.</p>
<p>It turned out that his application process was faster than using a Taobao agent.<br>When he paid, the page redirected to China CITIC Bank.<br>At first glance, the page looked old and he thought it was a phishing website…</p>
<h2 id="Interview"><a href="#Interview" class="headerlink" title="Interview"></a>Interview</h2><p>The U.S. Embassy in Beijing is located in Sanlitun, Chaoyang District.</p>
<p>He took the afternoon off for the interview.<br>When he arrived at the embassy, he was dumbfounded. He had only seen such long lines during the Spring Festival travel rush.<br>The line for the interview was full of twists and turns, like a winding mountain road, with thousands of people waiting in a zigzag pattern.<br>It took 3 hours of crawling to finally reach the interview window.</p>
<p>There were a total of 5-6 Chinese interview windows and 1 lonely English window.</p>
<p>His friend suddenly said that they could go to the English window since they could both speak English, and they wouldn’t have to wait.<br>Thinking about it, he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>The interviewer was an old lady, and he couldn’t remember exactly what she said, but roughly:</p>
<p>…<br>Him:  invited us to join their conference.<br>The old lady was surprised and asked, “Are you working for Apple?”<br>(After thinking for a moment, he realized that in 2019 he was actually working for Apple, but unfortunately it was still 2016, so he had to say,)<br>Him: No, it’s a developer conference.<br>Old lady: Why did they invite you?<br>…</p>
<p>He opened the folder and took out the  Invitation Letter.<br>The old lady pointed to the nearby Chinese window and asked him to go there.</p>
<p>The security guard girl who maintained order next to them asked what happened when she saw them being sent away.<br>Upon hearing the situation, she sighed and was relieved that they weren’t directly rejected, so she asked them to wait next to her for a while.</p>
<p>Then, they had an interview in Chinese with a foreign girl.<br>She was also confused about the conference.<br>She guessed that people outside the IT industry might not know what a conference is.<br>So he showed her the invitation letter, but the girl said she didn’t want to see it and asked him to explain why he was invited.</p>
<p>He was stunned because he thought that even if there was a language barrier before, why didn’t she want to see the materials this time?<br>Because he had heard various interview experiences, he had only heard of being denied a visa due to not bringing the necessary materials, but he had never heard of someone not looking at the materials at all.<br>Fortunately, his friend said it was a Developer Meeting, and the girl immediately understood (😓…).</p>
<p>Then she asked if he had any relatives in the USA, how long he would stay, when he would return, and where he would be staying.</p>
<p>After waiting for a long half-minute, the girl smiled and said congratulations, their visas were approved.<br>They would receive their passports by mail in a few working days.</p>
<p>Although there were twists and turns, he didn’t feel particularly happy.<br>He expressed his thanks and left with his friend.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he heard that a wealthy person who had lived in Boston for a long time had a Chinese interview and could have two people interviewed together.<br>They could even bring their whole family together for the interview.<br>He was really surprised.</p>
<p>The U.S. visa<br>had already fallen.<br>He said.</p>
<h2 id="Flight-Tickets"><a href="#Flight-Tickets" class="headerlink" title="Flight Tickets"></a>Flight Tickets</h2><p>When booking the flight tickets, he didn’t know that United Airlines had a bad reputation, so he chose not to fly with Air China due to their obsession with foreign airlines.<br>Plus, at that time, the infamous incident of Asian-American passenger being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight hadn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>In fact, regardless of which airline, a 12-hour flight would turn anyone into a zombie.<br>United Airlines wasn’t as strict and allowed the use of mobile phones 📴, so he took a photo of the horizon from the plane.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/usa-00-02.avif"></p>
<p>He never expected that he would encounter the flight number UA888 again in his FANNG job assignment four years later.</p>
<h2 id="Entry"><a href="#Entry" class="headerlink" title="Entry"></a>Entry</h2><p>After getting off the plane, they went through immigration.</p>
<p>He always had an illusion that there were snipers waiting behind the customs, ready to shoot suspects on the spot.<br>Being his first time stepping on foreign soil, he was a little nervous.</p>
<p>The customs officer asked a few common questions, such as the purpose of their visit and how long they would stay.<br>Based on the visa situation, he didn’t mention the conference but said it was a Developer Meeting.<br>Then the customs officer stamped their passports.</p>
<p>After retrieving their passports, they tried to look calm on the surface and walked faster, fearing that they might get shot.</p>
<p>When they saw some people waiting for them, they suddenly remembered that their friend hadn’t come out yet.<br>While waiting, they thought their friend might have encountered some trouble, but after a while, they saw him.<br>It turned out that he was also checked because of the mention of the conference.</p>
<p>Conferences are really dangerous 😂</p>
<h2 id="Downtown"><a href="#Downtown" class="headerlink" title="Downtown"></a>Downtown</h2><p>They picked up their car and went to the Airbnb to drop off their luggage 🧳.</p>
<p>It was quite far from San Francisco International Airport to downtown.<br>They didn’t expect that what was usually a long distance with heavy traffic in Beijing could be covered in just 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The 🏠 they rented from Airbnb turned out to be exactly the same as what was shown online, with no deception.<br>The house had two floors, made of wooden boards, and there was another tenant upstairs, so there might be some noise when they walked around.<br>There was also a nice garden in the back.</p>

<h2 id="Yosemite-National-Park"><a href="#Yosemite-National-Park" class="headerlink" title="Yosemite National Park"></a>Yosemite National Park</h2><blockquote>
<p>In 1984, Yosemite was designated as a World Heritage site, internationally recognized for its spectacular granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, and biological diversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They took a break from their journey and went to Yosemite National Park, which was about a 3-hour drive away. On the way, they saw a group of windmills.<br>Suddenly, they turned a corner and saw the wallpaper of OS X Yosemite.<br>Before, they had only seen mountains ⛰️ covered with soil in China, so this was the first time they saw bare, steep granite cliffs.<br>They made the wrong assumption that foreign mountains are harder than those in China.</p>

<p>It was truly amazing.</p>
<p>On the way back, he stared at the sunset 🌇 and lost himself in thought.</p>
