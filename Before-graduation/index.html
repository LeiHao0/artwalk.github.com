        <p>I had thoughts in my mind a while ago, but I haven’t had time to write it.<br>All kinds of gatherings, booking tickets, checking rental information, then level 6, and then rushing over to see the landlord that night, running in each district, checking the room paper<br>When the room paper is about to be settled, in the hotel, stroking the books, I can finally relax. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="get-together"><a href="#get-together" class="headerlink" title="get together"></a>get together</h2><p>This has always been my least favorite to participate. Schopenhauer’s “Either Vulgar or Lonely” is somewhat extreme, but it does have some truth.<br>In addition, it has something to do with my introversion. In the MBTI test, the introversion actually broke 85. I always like to stay quietly instead of crowded and noisy occasions.<br>And I don’t like photography very much. I don’t know if it’s a fragment from “Imprisoned Soul” I saw when I was a child: the photography will suck my soul away and fasten it on a small piece of paper, implanting the subconscious mind like Inception.<br>After graduating from middle school and high school, I left in a hurry. I remember that in the photos in the high school group, the water glasses on my table were all there, but the people were not there.<br>This time I graduated, but I took a lot of photos. Of course, most of them were mixed with Sister Orange and the big team </p>
<p>Youth, it’s really amazing, with so much innate aura, so many possibilities<br>I remember that freshman also goes to package night once a week, and goes to bed at 3~4 o’clock every day during winter vacation. After the junior year, it is obvious that the body is not good enough, and the senior year is even more obvious. Once in a hotel, I didn’t sleep until 3 o’clock. When I looked in the mirror the next day, I was surprised to find the legendary dark circles. Before, I wondered how the heroine in the novel said that she had dark circles. I never knew what it was. Secretly laughing that they can’t adjust, don’t understand health… </p>
<p>In the past, I have been recording the bits and pieces of the year through words. Now I think that the only result of doing this is to recall the youthful years of the year in an old-fashioned manner, the time of committing 2 and the mood of committing 2 back then. I don’t know what it looked like back then. </p>
<h2 id="leave-school"><a href="#leave-school" class="headerlink" title="leave school"></a>leave school</h2><p>Pack up things and wait for my brother to get off work<br>When it was almost time, the group of people in the bedroom decisively went out to eat…<br>Cui Wei, my former classmate of No. 1 Middle School, helped me take the package, Viagra, thank you! When I called, I took out my phone to check the destination, and found that when I forgot to come down to look for you in the bedroom, you were gone<br>Although you run so fast, but still have to thank you </p>
<p>When I arrived at my brother’s house and saw their new house, I realized that I had to buy paper for Shenma. I had always wanted to rent… </p>
<h2 id="Level-6"><a href="#Level-6" class="headerlink" title="Level 6"></a>Level 6</h2><p>Just arrived at the examination room and sat down, a boy came over, claiming to be “Ming Ji”, who was originally a member of the Lige group<br>I thought he was a sophomore, surprised! Found that the left is all sophomores, sigh…<br>No wonder so many children’s shoes for seniors missed the exam. Fortunately, the monitor was with Orange. Persevering in sitting for the last time, the result doesn’t matter anymore </p>
<h2 id="Hangzhou"><a href="#Hangzhou" class="headerlink" title="Hangzhou"></a>Hangzhou</h2><p>More than ten days ago, I started to find information online, various materials, and mind map summary<br>On the night after the sixth grade test, I had a small gathering with them. Kawaii ate the most expensive noodles in my life, and then I boarded the train.<br>The 6.20 alarm was set, and the small flag called to let me pay attention to the magical horse, and said that I could hardly sleep at night. And really wake up basically once an hour<br>I went to WC at 5 o’clock in the morning and went back to sleep again. I suddenly woke up at 6 o’clock and drank some Nutrition Express. I found it on Google Maps and found that I was in Yuhang District!<br>Isn’t it 6.40? Then I heard “I got off in Hangzhou”, O__O”… </p>
<p>After getting off the train station, there is nothing shocking. It seems that the station in my hometown is beautiful.<br>google map, look for route 49, see the bus stop there, walk over, go around and find that there is nothing </p>
<p>k49 7:30 to the Union Building, go to Home, and learn that you can enter the room at 8 o’clock, store your school bags, and go downstairs to the company<br>I went in from AB and found that someone was practicing Taijiquan. Anyway, Dai Yingdu came, after watching for a while, he went up and talked about practicing Chen’s boxing. When asked about a sense of air, I said that my fingers swelled a bit when I opened it, and then I pulled other people’s thoughts, and I was said to be wrong o(╯□╰)o </p>
<p>Just in time for the rain, finding a house is generally running in the rain<br>But after I paid the deposit for Shenma, the house started and the rain stopped… </p>
<p>I’ve known that it’s very clean, and I feel so when I get off the train.<br>But it just feels so<br>Until I saw two girls walking barefoot on the road…<br>If you are in Hefei, blood dripping is a must… </p>
<p>Kawaii once said to buy sandals, but never felt<br>The net shoes were all soaked when I went out one morning<br>I saw the two girls at that time<br>Suddenly my mind changed, and later I discovered that many people wear slippers<br>It seems that the beach pants + flip-flops of the uncle-level programmers are not false. </p>
<p>I can’t use online banking on my computer to buy train tickets<br>This phenomenon occurs in Brother Hao’s house. At that time, he bought it smoothly after switching to his computer.<br>I thought it was a problem with IE9, resetting to reset the initial state, no<br>Helpless to reinstall the system<br>But it seems that the mirroring is wrong, and the blue screen is directly…<br>And the wooden belt system restores the USB flash drive, so I can’t help asking JS for the system drive<br>Originally, I thought that the company was originally IT, and the system disk was a must. I thought there was a small IT department inside. </p>
<p>Buying tickets for Jiaxing this time delayed me for most of the day. In the end, my sister bought them for me.<br>This kind of regional bank doesn’t work well if it goes out of the region. Of course, as long as I stay in Anhui peacefully, Huizhou Bank can comfortably say that I don’t blame it or blame it. </p>
<p>It’s strange to be out for the first time<br>In the afternoon, I was still taking Level 6 exams, I was in Hangzhou after I slept at night, and I am going to Jiaxing again today.<br>For places I haven’t been to, it always feels like an unexplored map in a real-time strategy game. It’s dark, and the map can only be lighted up when I pass. </p>
<p>Ran to many places to see the house paper<br>I would like to thank Ying Children’s Shoes and Wearing Children’s Shoes for helping me find room paper in Hangzhou, where I am unfamiliar. Especially when I was wearing children’s shoes, the room paper was already set, and I continued to accompany me on the road.
