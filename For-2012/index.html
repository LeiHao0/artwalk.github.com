    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was still late to realize, originally meant to summarize it on New Year’s Day, dragged on until Chinese New Year, and then until today.</p>
<h2 id="Writing-in-2012"><a href="#Writing-in-2012" class="headerlink" title="Writing in 2012"></a>Writing in 2012</h2><p>For the month before Chinese New Year, I was restless and uneasy.<br>I don’t know if it’s because of being away from someone.<br>When I returned home for the New Year, looking at the snow flying in the sky, the earth covered in silver, my heart regained its tranquility.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>2012 was the year when I grew the most.<br>Not to mention the external changes, I can no longer use the standards of a student to demand myself.</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, I did nothing, just read some books at home and played games.<br>I remember the amazing work “Treating Time as a Friend.”<br>It took me a month to read it, intermittently.<br>Afterwards, I felt that the world was different.<br>Perhaps from that time, I fell in love with reading.</p>
<h2 id="Overcompensation"><a href="#Overcompensation" class="headerlink" title="Overcompensation"></a>Overcompensation</h2><p>I still remember in my sophomore year when I was practicing tai chi from being rigid to becoming soft, I had a conversation with my teacher.<br>He said I swayed too vigorously and asked a classmate to record a video with their phone, so I could see for myself.<br>At that time, I was stunned, and said, I thought this was a necessary process.</p>
<p>Yes, this is overcompensation.</p>
<p>There was also back pain that I felt in high school.<br>That’s when I started exploring traditional medicine.<br>But recently, I also started feeling pain in my limbs and neck pillow.<br>I heard a sentence in “The Winter Wu Equation” that said, “When you become aware of his existence, it may mean there is a problem.”<br>Originally, I thought it was more serious, suspecting that I was close to death.<br>But recently, in “The Art of Learning,” I read that it might be because I just started learning tai chi and I am feeling things that I didn’t feel before.<br>In any case, I continue to calm down and handle everything.</p>
<h2 id="A-Glimpse"><a href="#A-Glimpse" class="headerlink" title="A Glimpse"></a>A Glimpse</h2><p>Sometimes it’s strange, you can notice her with just one glance in a crowd.<br>Even if it’s not the first glance, after a short period of time, in the vast sea of people, you will still notice this person.<br>Just by seeing her, you can differentiate her from the people around her.<br>Background, personality, occupation, hobbies, you don’t know any of it, but you can still feel that she’s special.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, I went to the West City Ice Rink. It was my second time ice skating in my life.<br>I really enjoy ice skating.<br>Firstly, it allows me to experience the difficulties of being an upright animal and trains my cerebellum.<br>Secondly, it helps me redefine balance, which should complement tai chi.<br>So I decided to make it a regular weekend activity.<br>For now, I’m still relying on friction, but I hope to use centripetal force next time.</p>
<h2 id="Impatience"><a href="#Impatience" class="headerlink" title="Impatience"></a>Impatience</h2><p>Everyone says this is an impatient society.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s the trend.<br>There’s a saying: When you live in an abnormal place for a long time, you will consider abnormal to be normal.</p>
<p>I don’t deny that I’m impatient.<br>I want to do everything, but I haven’t delved deep into anything.<br>But I’m also helpless, my broad reading and attention only started in my senior year.<br>What’s the use of knowing GTD?<br>The key is the quality of time utilization, not the quantity.<br>In flow - when in the state of flow, time stops for you.</p>
<p>Impatience is also about how to balance depth and breadth.<br>First, broaden, as Steve Jobs said, keep trying and discovering, in the end, you will find your interests.<br>In my first two years of college, I was entangled with programming, naively thinking that it would be a lifelong thing.<br>And I thought that as long as I became an expert, a genius, I wouldn’t have to worry about money.<br>I also prided myself on working for my interests, not money.<br>Now looking back, I was so silly and naive at that time.<br>During the carefree four years of college, I didn’t broaden myself, although it’s a little late now, I still have to continue doing it.</p>
<h2 id="Touching"><a href="#Touching" class="headerlink" title="Touching"></a>Touching</h2><p>Thank you to those friends in Hefei (originally I disliked this term, but later discovered another meaning, Chinese culture is truly profound), every time I was upset, I would come to you to vent.<br>Thanks to those who have accompanied me through a period of time.<br>And that someone, when they found out that I failed five courses and didn’t get a bachelor’s degree in psychology and didn’t get into graduate school, out of helplessness, they traveled all over for a humble salary, and even consoled me when I was devastated the day before my birthday, instead of blaming me.</p>
<h2 id="Three-Lives-Stone"><a href="#Three-Lives-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Three Lives Stone"></a>Three Lives Stone</h2><p>The name alone sounds cool.</p>
<p>The first time I came across it was in “The Record of Searching for Gods”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lying on the Three Lives Stone, I understand my past lives and future lives. Drinking from the Worry-free Spring, I forget about love and hate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last time when Time Card came to Hangzhou, when I googled Hangzhou’s attractions, I suddenly discovered the Three Lives Stone.<br>At the end of my 22nd year, there were many things that deviated from the development I imagined.<br>And I realized that everything I have done may be just escapism (escaping from what?).</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing was that after a nap, my brain recompiled and ran everything according to what I wanted.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I found that I had slept deeply and felt relaxed, just like the time when Zhao told me about BL in my college years.</p>
<p>Then I went to look at the Three Lives Stone, not for any other reason, but because if you remove “life,” it’s my name.</p>
<h2 id="Pragmatism-and-Freedom"><a href="#Pragmatism-and-Freedom" class="headerlink" title="Pragmatism and Freedom"></a>Pragmatism and Freedom</h2><p>I understood what true liberalism is, and understood the role of inheritance tax.</p>
<p>I understood that I may not have independent opinions and critical thinking, there is a huge gap between me and that.</p>
<p>I understood that I felt too good about myself after “The Happiness Course,” to the point of overcompensating.</p>
<p>I understood that I still can’t give promises to others, no matter who that person is.</p>
<p>I understood that in order to avoid disappointment for myself or others, I frequently choose to do nothing.</p>
<p>I understood that sometimes, by observing calmly, opportunities are lost.</p>
<p>I understood that once I’m frustrated, I will still feel upset.</p>
<p>But I still don’t understand, what, when, where, who, why, how.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I feel that everything I do is just a small play. Even if I make changes, what difference does it make? I still feel a sense of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Stunted pines in the deep valley, and vanished seedlings on the distant mountains.<br>By comparing their statures, the shade is extended hundreds of feet.</p>
<p>Wan says she recently discovered that as long as you work hard, you will achieve.</p>
<p>But my model here is that it is not necessarily achievable. At least the real result and my modeling will have a lot of differences.</p>
<h2 id="Hope"><a href="#Hope" class="headerlink" title="Hope"></a>Hope</h2><p>Of course, I think this might be my way of absolving myself, finding a noble reason for myself.<br>Of course, it is more likely that what I said is wrong.<br>But no matter what, no matter how much I sigh, the weird 22 has passed.<br>Sometimes I feel like there’s a clock ticking in the alarm clock.<br>Whether it is a joyous observation of inner time or an understanding of the passage of time.<br>Indeed, time slips away like this, unable to let go of day and night.</p>
<p>I also know that hope doesn’t matter, whether it exists or not.<br>But I can’t help but hope, already on the road to the end of the third cycle.<br>I hope to have a breakthrough, just like the name of a game by Microsoft: The Rise of the Nation.</p>
