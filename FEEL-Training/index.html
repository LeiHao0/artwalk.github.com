    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="Day-One"><a href="#Day-One" class="headerlink" title="Day One"></a>Day One</h2><p>On the first day of training, the executives took turns introducing themselves.<br>I met the real CEO, COO, CTO, and CFO for the first time.<br>Lunch was a bit awkward, it seemed like a private room was reserved for the executives. But they all went back, and only a few of us ended up eating there. Luckily, more colleagues arrived later.<br>After signing the contract in the afternoon, I went to my workstation.<br>There was a big gap between the curtains next to the window, and the strong sunlight was shining directly onto my LCD monitor, making it impossible to see anything…<br>Of course, it turned out that I wasn’t the unluckiest one. The unluckiest person was our manager, who was directly told by another colleague that he was there to sunbathe…</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>I set up my computer, uninstalled that crappy software, and configured it to my preferred environment.<br>Of course, the company’s internet speed was too slow… I went back to copy some large software files.<br>Then, I saw a colleague named You Jie. Surprisingly, she still remembered me. We chatted for a while and then the entire browser department had a small meeting.</p>
<p>Ah, the saying “more money, fewer words, die early” is quite sarcastic. Everyone is in the technical field, so there’s not much talking, and I have nothing to say either.<br>After going back, the manager assigned a task. After a while, I realized it was already after 6 o’clock. Wasn’t that quitting time? Why is there no sign of anyone leaving? I asked in the group chat and found out that everyone was conflicted about when to leave.<br>I could only stay put. At 8, I saw the mentor leave. Since the mentor was leaving, I had to follow suit. I said hello to the manager and ran back~</p>
<h2 id="Day-Two"><a href="#Day-Two" class="headerlink" title="Day Two"></a>Day Two</h2><p>We were randomly divided into small teams and came up with team names and slogans.<br>For the first time, we saw how different opinions were summarized.<br>In the end, our team name and slogan were “Bubbling Fish / I’m a Bubbling Fish, I Love Bubbling”.<br>(On the third day, I saw a cute clownfish. I took it and realized it was called “Bubbling Fish”. It was a coincidence!)<br>The poster: Y+ doing UI is so awesome, the bubbles drawn by a few team members look lifelike and cute.</p>
<p>Various processes were complex and intertwined. For now, I can only use the administrative department - there’s only one key for the drawer. The sun is glaring.</p>
<p>The last imitation was too much like 2. I don’t think it’s an observation problem, but rather a thinking misconception. It’s a pity that I’ve read a lot of books on thinking, but still didn’t notice it.<br>Fortunately, Fan Xi is good at this kind of problem and solved it first.</p>
<h2 id="Day-Three"><a href="#Day-Three" class="headerlink" title="Day Three"></a>Day Three</h2><p>Time was getting tighter. Yesterday, I still had some free time and went back to set up the development environment. Today, there was no time for that.<br>We were assigned to draw the logo for SKY. Everyone could do it.<br>The purpose was to make everyone understand the importance of following the rules.</p>
<p>Then, we were given random drawings and had to layout a newspaper.<br>I thought about acquiring Apple, but luckily our group didn’t start writing about it. Later, when I saw another group used this idea, I immediately gave up.<br>There were also some sensitive issues that Xiao Dong said not to mention, so we didn’t.</p>
<p>Yan Yan sent 10 questions. In the evening, we had to perform them in the form of a skit and insert the questions into it.<br>During lunch, we quickly gathered the answers to the questions.<br>Soon after, it was time for the training in the afternoon.<br>They called it a “brainwashing” training, and the part about mobile internet in the YY video made me wish I were born a hundred years later.<br>Our group was assigned to do an innovative performance, and we adopted Far Brother’s suggestion.<br>Don’t judge a book by its cover; Far Brother may be a little MM (slang for cute and petite girl), but she is open-minded and passionate.<br>Zhao Yang is quite talented as a host. He said a lot of nonsense throughout the process.<br>Xiao Dong kept saying he wasn’t good, but he performed well on the spot.<br>I was the referee, so I was just a bystander~</p>
<p>Then, we only had one hour to discuss the skit for the evening.<br>Far Brother was always the one with the most active thinking. During the discussion, I finally realized that I wasn’t really a young person born in the 90s, I’m not mentally handicapped.</p>
<p>Until the first group went on stage, we still hadn’t decided on the final ending, which is something we need to pay attention to in the future.<br>The skit overall was very good, but there was a little hiccup in the middle.</p>
<p>At that moment, I saw “Don’t live in someone else’s world,” and went out to get some water. I happened to meet two interns who had been there early. I had seen one of them during a meal, greeted them, and then sat down to chat for a while. The other one kept asking me about Hefei, which university I went to.<br>Of course, it’s China Other University, I said it twice but they looked confused, which made my confidence drop. My spoken English still wasn’t good…<br>What surprised me was that Hangzhou Institute of Technology is also COU (a pun in Chinese).<br>I mentioned that most of our university’s graduates find jobs locally, earning about 2k, and he frowned. Later, I realized he probably forgot that the cost of living in Hefei is low.<br>Then JS came over and told me that we can borrow books from the Beitie Library on Friday.<br>I played Wii for a while, returned to the classroom, and realized that the performance hadn’t ended yet…</p>
<p>After everything ended, Yan Yan said…<br>…<br>Well, time was even tighter now. We briefly discussed the work distribution for the marketing plan since it was so late, and then we disbanded.</p>
<p>When I reached the main gate, I bumped into Far Brother, who said she needed to pick up a package, a big one with paper and stuff. Since it was already late, and we were at Fuyuan, I decided to go with her and take a look.<br>Walking with this girl made me feel dangerous.<br>After going around for a while, we finally found the YunDa pickup point. It turned out that someone she knew had already picked it up.<br>It wasn’t my concern anymore, so I left.</p>
<p>The first taxi didn’t stop! Hey, I got on the second one and told the driver that the one in front refused to take me? Seeing my silent expression, he explained it for a while, basically telling me not to complain. Well, actually I was just tired and said that, I didn’t have the energy to complain.</p>
<p>I had to do laundry when I got back. So many trivial things…</p>
<h2 id="Day-Four"><a href="#Day-Four" class="headerlink" title="Day Four"></a>Day Four</h2><p>Hao Ge can really talk, it felt like hours passed in an instant, my throat would have gone hoarse.<br>Later, I found out that he used to be a lecturer in the past and had practiced, no wonder.<br>There was a brainstorming session, and we had to come up with the purpose of an iron clothes rack. The balance wasn’t very good, but it could be balanced using the algorithm: score = total score / 10.<br>Of course, the market isn’t fair either, there are always monopoly companies that have the final say. I told the team not to pay too much attention to others, just focus on doing our best.<br>Squatting, ah, I forgot this in Tai Chi.<br>I squatted for less than two minutes, but my legs got sore.<br>There was a voice inside me, saying that I am an intellectual hero, not good at recognizing my position, always trying to show strength, but if I fall, the team won’t be complete tomorrow.<br>After realizing this, I immediately jumped up (and realized that I still had the energy to jump up…).<br>Before the tabletop games in the evening, I bumped into Yan Yan during dinner and helped her move some things in the administrative department.<br>Then I went to play table tennis for a while.<br>The game was the mafia game, and everyone was having a great time.<br>Far Brother talked a lot and confused everyone.<br>Zhao Yang did a great job as the host, but he also rambled a lot.<br>Xiao Dong kept saying he couldn’t do it, but he did well on the spot.<br>I was the judge, so I was just a spectator~</p>
<p>Then we only had an hour to discuss the skit for the evening.<br>Far Brother was always the one with the most active thinking. During the discussion, I finally realized that I wasn’t really a young person born in the 90s, I’m not mentally handicapped.</p>

<h2 id="Day-Four-1"><a href="#Day-Four-1" class="headerlink" title="Day Four"></a>Day Four</h2><p>Hao Ge can really talk, it felt like hours passed in an instant, my throat would have gone hoarse.<br>Later, I found out that he used to be a lecturer in the past and had practiced, no wonder.<br>There was a brainstorming session, and we had to come up with the purpose of an iron clothes rack. The balance wasn’t very good, but it could be balanced using the algorithm: score = total score / 10.<br>Of course, the market isn’t fair either, there are always monopoly companies that have the final say. I told the team not to pay too much attention to others, just focus on doing our best.<br>Squatting, ah, I forgot this in Tai Chi.<br>I squatted for less than two minutes, but my legs got sore.<br>There was a voice inside me, saying that I am an intellectual hero, not good at recognizing my position, always trying to show strength, but if I fall, the team won’t be complete tomorrow.<br>After realizing this, I immediately jumped up (and realized that I still had the energy to jump up…).<br>In the evening’s tabletop games, during dinner, I met Yan Yan and helped her move some things in the administrative department.<br>Then I went to play table tennis for a while.<br>The game was the mafia game, and everyone was having a great time.<br>Far Brother talked a lot and confused everyone.<br>Zhao Yang did a great job as the host, but he also rambled a lot.<br>Xiao Dong kept saying he couldn’t do it, but he did well on the spot.<br>I was the judge, so I was just a bystander~</p>
<p>Then we only had an hour to discuss the skit for the evening.<br>Far Brother was always the one with the most active thinking. During the discussion, I finally realized that I wasn’t really a young person born in the 90s, I’m not mentally handicapped.</p>
<p>Until the first group went on stage, we still hadn’t decided on the final ending, which is something we need to pay attention to in the future.<br>The skit overall was very good, but there was a little hiccup in the middle.</p>
<p>At that moment, I saw “Don’t live in someone else’s world,” and went out to get some water. I happened to meet two interns who had been there early. I had seen one of them during a meal, greeted them, and then sat down to chat for a while. The other one kept asking me about Hefei, which university I went to.<br>Of course, it’s China Other University, I said it twice but they looked confused, which made my confidence drop. My spoken English still wasn’t good…<br>What surprised me was that Hangzhou Institute of Technology is also COU (a pun in Chinese).<br>I mentioned that most of our university’s graduates find jobs locally, earning about 2k, and he frowned. Later, I realized he probably forgot that the cost of living in Hefei is low.<br>Then JS came over and told me that we can borrow books from the Beitie Library on Friday.<br>I played Wii for a while, returned to the classroom, and realized that the performance hadn’t ended yet…</p>
<p>After everything ended, Yan Yan said…<br>…<br>Well, time was even tighter now, we briefly discussed the work distribution for the marketing plan since it was so late, and then we disbanded.</p>
<p>When I reached the main gate, I bumped into Far Brother, who said she needed to pick up a package, a big one with paper and stuff. Since it was already late, and we were at Fuyuan, I decided to go with her and take a look.<br>Walking with this girl made me feel dangerous.<br>We went around for a while and finally found the YunDa pickup point. It turned out that someone she knew had already picked it up.<br>It wasn’t my concern anymore, so I left.</p>
<p>The first taxi didn’t stop! Hey, I got on the second one and told the driver that the one in front refused to take me? Seeing my silent expression, he explained it for a while, basically telling me not to complain. Well, actually I was just tired and said that, I didn’t have the energy to complain.</p>
<p>When I got back, I had to do laundry. So many trivial things…</p>
<h2 id="Day-Five"><a href="#Day-Five" class="headerlink" title="Day Five"></a>Day Five</h2><p>After the training ended today, I cautiously asked the manager if there was anything I could work on since I had nothing to do.<br>The manager immediately said that Sen Brother had already prepared tasks, he just hadn’t mentioned it yet.<br>(So that’s how it is T.T)<br>…</p>
<h2 id="Day-Six"><a href="#Day-Six" class="headerlink" title="Day Six"></a>Day Six</h2><p>West Lake orienteering<br>We left at 6:50 am, but it took another hour and a half to start at the Broken Bridge.<br>I even ran into the team captain on the bus, and Yan Jiao was also on the same bus…</p>
<p>West Lake was very hot, so our team bought some fans.<br>After receiving the task, we set off.</p>
<p>We had to reenact a classic scene from the Legend of the White Snake, showcasing the beautiful scenery and food to make foreign tourists write “Hello Hangzhou…” and some other tasks.<br>A large group of people came towards us, and Far Brother and Yi Jia immediately rushed over.<br>Hmm, their English was indeed intermittent, they still relied on the tour guide for translation…<br>I could kind of understand their conversation, but I couldn’t respond…<br>There was a shorter lady next to me, who looked Asian, and just a few years older than me. I was struggling with whether to talk to her, and finally, for the first time, I spoke to a foreigner and asked a silly question, “Where are you from?”<br>The US, Australia, etc.<br>Then I didn’t know what else to say… English was really like being mute…</p>
<p>Far Brother had already solved two puzzles before I could react…<br>O__O”…<br>My only contribution was to ask them to set aside the ones they couldn’t solve and move on to the next one. In the end, we used the process of elimination to see if there was a breakthrough.<br>In the end, we finished in a little over 3 minutes, but unfortunately got two wrong (later found out we had the highest accuracy in the shortest amount of time).</p>
<p>Third task, “Intellectual Theft of the Nuclear Warhead”</p>
<p>In a four-meter square area, there was a cup. We had to pour a bottle of water into it using ropes, rubber bands, chopsticks, and straws, without anyone entering the area and without any of the items touching the ground.</p>
<p>My suggestion was to poke two holes, so we just needed to lift the bottle over the cup, even though some water might spill along the way. But they were afraid it would be slower that way.<br>Later, I found out that Fan Xi’s team, Qianjiang No. 7, used this method. Now thinking about it, this method might make the water flow slower, but it would save time in coordinating tying the ropes and pouring the water.<br>In the end, we went with the most traditional method, pouring the water.</p>
<p>Taking out the cup<br>I thought about wrapping it multiple times, wrapping it in the opposite direction, and then pulling it out. Of course, later when I watched the video, I realized that another group failed with this method. Luckily, they said it wasn’t stable enough and suggested using a half hitch, which vetoed this plan.<br>Then I saw the team captain playing around with chopsticks and rubber bands, so I went over to ask him (I couldn’t tie knots, so I couldn’t help there) about his idea.<br>Afterwards, I guess Far Brother saw him holding the rubber band, and suddenly she ran over quickly, shouting, “I know, I know!”</p>
<p>She suggested stacking N rubber bands together, using four ropes to pull them apart, then looping them around the cup, and slowly lifting it up. We all listened !!!<br>Then we immediately thought of some points to pay attention to. After all, with more rubber bands, there is more elasticity, so if the cup isn’t properly secured, it’s more likely to fall over.<br>Then we began the implementation. I was in charge of observation.<br>Jepen seemed a bit nervous and the ropes were kept tense, the cup shaking.<br>We coordinated our voices, and in the end, we completed the final activity with a perfect score.</p>
<p>Catching the bus<br>Jepen said the other teams had already finished, and time was running out (they shouldn’t have motivated us like that, we went back and found out many teams hadn’t arrived yet).<br>We went the wrong way, luckily we didn’t go too far…<br>Suddenly the bus came, and everyone ran across the road (I and Xiao Dong felt that our lives were more important, we were the slowest to cross the road).<br>On the bus, the team captain suddenly saw a contact’s phone number for the last bus stop. I thought it would be necessary to mention it, what if they were still waiting for us there. After the call, I found out they had already left…</p>
<p>DV<br>I didn’t expect Bo Bo Jie (a nickname) was recording, it was really interesting at the time.<br>I saw myself standing there, blindfolded, feeling really silly, I won’t say any more…<br>Yan Jiao’s group in the “Intellectual Theft of the Nuclear Warhead” task used the method of squeezing the bottle to fill the cup two meters away, and then they even wanted to climb a tree.<br>Some even wanted to tie someone up and hoist them over. Really awesome.</p>
<p>Finally<br>I didn’t care about the ranking, as long as we weren’t last.<br>Of course, we unquestionably got first place. In the evening, we went to Grandma’s house for our team’s first gathering, it was so happy.<br>I also saw Far Brother’s wallpaper.</p>
<p>Thoughts<br>In university, I always went my own way. Although I knew teamwork was important, I couldn’t really feel it. When I interviewed last year and talked about teamwork, it was uncertain. This training allowed me to personally experience the magic of teamwork, it’s really amazing…</p>
<p>FEEL training is almost over. Although I’m exhausted every day, I’m really grateful to everyone in Bubbling Fish. O(∩_∩)O Thank you all.</p>
