<p>What we can do now is to find a quiet place, let ourselves think quietly, and understand how to do it, so that we can prevent precious things and important people from losing again, and understand how to do it.

<a id="more"></a>

<p>In the first two weeks, I got up at 6 o’clock and went to bed at 11 o’clock every day. I felt very energetic. It’s not a problem to work 16 hours a day.<br>The side effects came out<br>I didn’t work overtime for these two days, I was nestled in my house without internet, and I deeply realized the terrible loneliness.<br>Become inexplicably irritable, unfortunately the mobile phone can be connected to the Internet, so harassment everywhere<br>The most common one is Gu Xiaobai’s “So boring, so boring” in “The Gang of Men”<br>Sorry for causing trouble to some people. As for when it will stabilize, I don’t know </p>
<h2 id="007-and-the-Grand-Master"><a href="#007-and-the-Grand-Master" class="headerlink" title="007 and the Grand Master"></a>007 and the Grand Master</h2><p>In college, every once in a while, I would go to the theater to watch big movies<br>I didn’t have any money at that time, and I was only willing to go once because it was an international blockbuster + 3D<br>Work, but left these entertainments behind </p>
<p>I went to watch “007” the other night<br>Very worried </p>
<p>I came out and remembered the comment of verycd “Assassin’s Creed”: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>After going in for a while, I felt a sense of desolation. Although the city is more prosperous and the characters are more gorgeous, but facing Ezio, who is more than half a century old, it is a desolate time. From the beginning of the second generation, the young and young hairy boy to this one. The old man with a gray face and beard climbing the wall has a lot of thoughts. A few days ago, it happened that I also celebrated my birthday. It feels that year after year is getting faster and more like this game, I am already old when I look at myself in a blink of an eye<br>A person’s life is vividly revealed in this assassin trilogy </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The Great Master” has many touches, so I won’t talk about them one by one.<br>The most touching point:<br>Ip Man went to break the cake in Haneda’s hand, and couldn’t handle it.<br>Mr. Accountant commented that Tai Chi Yang Luchan has the stunt of “the bird does not fly”. The bird stopped in Yang Luchan’s palm and it could not fly, because Yang Luchan’s tricks made the bird nowhere to focus. Was locked in an invisible cage. </p>
<p>I specifically checked this story, here </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The little sparrow was alive and kicking, but it looked like a sick leg in the palm of the martial arts master Yang Luchan. Although he kept flapping his wings, it was caught by magnetism, squeaking, and unable to fly. If you want to fly, your feet must be balanced on the point of effort, and you can use the rebound force to lift your wings to fly. Yang Luchan’s kung fu has reached the peak of perfection, and the palm can feel the momentary thrust of the sparrow’s legs, whenever a sparrow When he kicked his legs to fly, he sank his palms, and the bird’s kicking force was wiped out! Therefore, the little sparrow could only flutter his wings and struggle, and could not do without Yang Luchan’s palm.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story may be exaggerated, but whether it is true or not, it arouses my interest in continuing Tai Chi </p>
<p>In parks, middle-aged and elderly people usually practice the 24 styles of the national standard. It evolved from the Yang family and is actually Tai Chi.<br>There is a piece of history here, it’s more sensitive, so I won’t talk about it. You can adapt it by google Tai Chi yourself </p>
<p>Seeing such softness + weakness in my freshman year, I suddenly had no idea<br>Later, it was discovered that the Yang family was actually evolved from the Chen family, and the Chen family can be vocal when fighting. It is super suitable for young people, and my physical fitness has been poor. </p>
<p>However, from the initial fastness to the present slowness, I realized how powerful Yang’s “rigid and softness is contained, but hidden deep.”<br>My understanding is that Yang has already externalized and embodied Wangsijin, without seeing the slightest on the outside. Jin circling and flipping inside, and once you get your hands on it, it’s done… </p>
<p>I used to sit on the well and watch the sky again </p>
<h2 id="It-took-me-eighteen-years-to-sit-with-you-and-drink-coffee"><a href="#It-took-me-eighteen-years-to-sit-with-you-and-drink-coffee" class="headerlink" title="It took me eighteen years to sit with you and drink coffee"></a>It took me eighteen years to sit with you and drink coffee</h2><p>Every time I see Xue Yuan, I count how much money I have taken and how much I have saved now, and every time it counts too much, it makes me think that I have realized my dream in a few years. </p>
<p>This is quite speechless, and only a little bit more. What’s the use? Life is a mess, wandering on the edge of pessimism and anxiety<br>In fact, what I want to say is, why are there so many more for no reason? How much do you need to pay for this<br>An article that impressed me a lot so far:<br>“It took me eighteen years to sit and drink coffee with you” </p>
<p>My university is china other university, which is already weak<br>At the stage of school recruitment, it was the first time to face the students from the other two schools, and felt helpless. </p>
<p>J.K. Rowling’s speech at the graduation ceremony of Harvard University:<br>The Fringe Benefits of Failure, and the Importance of Imagination (“The benefits of failure and the importance of imagination”)<br>There is a sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person’s idea of success, so high have you already flown academically. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I have always envied those students from prestigious schools. I envy their starting point, which is already so high.<br>How many times does it take to catch up with them, and it’s just possible </p>
<p>Every stage has troubles at every stage<br>I don’t know if I see a little bit more, but because of this, it makes me miserable<br>Because of that, I know how big the gap is, and I feel helpless to my weak self.<br>Every thing, every direction, it takes time to do </p>
<p>I don’t want myself as a Weibo complained: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too late to figure out what I want, the temples have begun to turn white; too late to be sure of their love, the other side is already married; too late to love the child, he has grown up and left you; too late to become famous, we are about to enter The grave is gone. We are afraid that everything is too late </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the second has already been fulfilled </p>
<p>Become the kind of person you hated most when you were young<br>When a person chooses to grow up, he often chooses not to be understood, because you have to take the path you choose, not the path they think you should choose.<br>I don’t know if at this stage, mom and dad don’t know what I’m thinking anymore<br>Actually I don’t know what I’m thinking, let alone others<br>And, a while ago, I found that I was becoming someone I didn’t like<br>Everything is cautious, not dare to expose who you are<br>As one sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The loss of many people is against their aspirations when they were young. I think I am mature, skilled, shrewd, naive in the past, I finally see it through and want to wear it. So, we became the kind of people we hated most when we were young </p>
</blockquote>
<p>not happy things<br>When I’m sad, no one cares about me<br>I feel dizzy when I see a full screen of English<br>The number of books you want to read is as many as the PM in the Imperial Capital </p>
<p>The theory knows:<br>Take your time, everything is too late<br>Where is weak, where is it<br>Do only one thing at a time<br>Power of the moment<br>Assigned task, the most difficult thing in the world </p>
<p>It seems to be on the road of self-salvation<br>However, the weak burst like this, and sometimes I really feel hopeless </p>
<p>Half a year after graduation<br>It’s been half a year<br>The end of the world is over </p>
<p>Objectively speaking, there seems to be progress<br>But the curve drawn is infinitely close to the horizontal line </p>
<p>Chao Wendao </p>
<p>There is another place that makes me very depressed </p>
<p>In Da Liu’s science fiction, there is an article called “The Way of the Chaos”,<br>Quoting from “The Analects of Confucius Liren”<br>It gives a detailed description of scientists willing to give their lives in order to understand the mysteries of the universe. </p>
<p>Although there is a sequence of hearings, it is nothing more than a big deal. </p>
<p>But there is a sentence in the Tao Te Ching: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sergeant hears the Tao and walks diligently; the sergeant hears the Tao, if it survives; the corporal laughs when he hears the Tao. Not smiling is not enough. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not smiling, not enough<br>The obvious feeling is that I saw the book “Poor Dad” in my sophomore year in the library. I flipped through it at the time. When it came to the coining section, it felt boring. I thought that I would not do business by myself anyway. In the future, I will use programming as my career and narrow my goals, so I won’t spend time looking at this </p>
<p>Now it seems ridiculous how stupid it was at that time, it can be said that the Tao is right in front of me, but I turn a deaf ear to it </p>
<h2 id="Superego-ego-and-id"><a href="#Superego-ego-and-id" class="headerlink" title="Superego, ego and id"></a>Superego, ego and id</h2><p>Everyone lives in three states of yourself: parent, adult, and child.<br>They correspond to the personality structure of Freud: the superego, the ego and the id.<br>The superego represents the law, morality, conscience, authority, the defender of order, the strict prosecutor, the god, the god, the enlightened Zen master, and the principle of perfection.<br>The id following the principle of happiness is all primitive impulses, instincts and desires, willful, do whatever one wants, and self-centered.<br>The self follows the principles of reality, the coordinator and the balancer, he is in the middle, not only to satisfy the desire of the self, but also to escape the eyes of the prosecutor, and cannot completely violate the will of the superego. The ego is like a businessman, and can be bargained; the id and the superego are at the two ends of the seesaw, and the ego is in the middle, so they need to be balanced. The self is rational and follows the principles of reality. </p>
<p>Why am I so sad, everything, I think, may be the super-ego too awesome </p>
<p>I have always had a shadow in my heart, that is, in all the fields I know, programming, Tai Chi, meridian, psychology, mind, and recently finance has achieved great success and peaked me.<br>I have never had a conversation with him directly, there is always only one shadow<br>As said in “God, Xueba, Man”, “God is not a bird of us”<br>But I have been trying to control my desire carefully, chasing after the shadow </p>
<p>There are a lot of trivial things and I don’t have time to listen to inner voice<br>And most of the time, I am satisfied with my choice<br>But a person, at home, closes the doors and windows, all around you are lonely, and when you are alone<br>Will face the godlike opponent of the superego and the piglike ally of the self </p>
<p>Only to realize that I was so fragile, even cowardly and crying<br>No pain no gain, but sometimes I wonder if the price is too great, what is it to toss about? It’s better to live a small life peacefully, why not be happy </p>
<p>How to balance the gap<br>I think that all the powerlessness and sorrow come from this </p>
