    <title>More than ten days before graduation</title>
    <url>/Before-graduation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I had thoughts in my mind a while ago, but I haven’t had time to write it.<br>All kinds of gatherings, booking tickets, checking rental information, then level 6, and then rushing over to see the landlord that night, running in each district, checking the room paper<br>When the room paper is about to be settled, in the hotel, stroking the books, I can finally relax. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="get-together"><a href="#get-together" class="headerlink" title="get together"></a>get together</h2><p>This has always been my least favorite to participate. Schopenhauer’s “Either Vulgar or Lonely” is somewhat extreme, but it does have some truth.<br>In addition, it has something to do with my introversion. In the MBTI test, the introversion actually broke 85. I always like to stay quietly instead of crowded and noisy occasions.<br>And I don’t like photography very much. I don’t know if it’s a fragment from “Imprisoned Soul” I saw when I was a child: the photography will suck my soul away and fasten it on a small piece of paper, implanting the subconscious mind like Inception.<br>After graduating from middle school and high school, I left in a hurry. I remember that in the photos in the high school group, the water glasses on my table were all there, but the people were not there.<br>This time I graduated, but I took a lot of photos. Of course, most of them were mixed with Sister Orange and the big team </p>
<p>Youth, it’s really amazing, with so much innate aura, so many possibilities<br>I remember that freshman also goes to package night once a week, and goes to bed at 3~4 o’clock every day during winter vacation. After the junior year, it is obvious that the body is not good enough, and the senior year is even more obvious. Once in a hotel, I didn’t sleep until 3 o’clock. When I looked in the mirror the next day, I was surprised to find the legendary dark circles. Before, I wondered how the heroine in the novel said that she had dark circles. I never knew what it was. Secretly laughing that they can’t adjust, don’t understand health… </p>
<p>In the past, I have been recording the bits and pieces of the year through words. Now I think that the only result of doing this is to recall the youthful years of the year in an old-fashioned manner, the time of committing 2 and the mood of committing 2 back then. I don’t know what it looked like back then. </p>
<h2 id="leave-school"><a href="#leave-school" class="headerlink" title="leave school"></a>leave school</h2><p>Pack up things and wait for my brother to get off work<br>When it was almost time, the group of people in the bedroom decisively went out to eat…<br>Cui Wei, my former classmate of No. 1 Middle School, helped me take the package, Viagra, thank you! When I called, I took out my phone to check the destination, and found that when I forgot to come down to look for you in the bedroom, you were gone<br>Although you run so fast, but still have to thank you </p>
<p>When I arrived at my brother’s house and saw their new house, I realized that I had to buy paper for Shenma. I had always wanted to rent… </p>
<h2 id="Level-6"><a href="#Level-6" class="headerlink" title="Level 6"></a>Level 6</h2><p>Just arrived at the examination room and sat down, a boy came over, claiming to be “Ming Ji”, who was originally a member of the Lige group<br>I thought he was a sophomore, surprised! Found that the left is all sophomores, sigh…<br>No wonder so many children’s shoes for seniors missed the exam. Fortunately, the monitor was with Orange. Persevering in sitting for the last time, the result doesn’t matter anymore </p>
<h2 id="Hangzhou"><a href="#Hangzhou" class="headerlink" title="Hangzhou"></a>Hangzhou</h2><p>More than ten days ago, I started to find information online, various materials, and mind map summary<br>On the night after the sixth grade test, I had a small gathering with them. Kawaii ate the most expensive noodles in my life, and then I boarded the train.<br>The 6.20 alarm was set, and the small flag called to let me pay attention to the magical horse, and said that I could hardly sleep at night. And really wake up basically once an hour<br>I went to WC at 5 o’clock in the morning and went back to sleep again. I suddenly woke up at 6 o’clock and drank some Nutrition Express. I found it on Google Maps and found that I was in Yuhang District!<br>Isn’t it 6.40? Then I heard “I got off in Hangzhou”, O__O”… </p>
<p>After getting off the train station, there is nothing shocking. It seems that the station in my hometown is beautiful.<br>google map, look for route 49, see the bus stop there, walk over, go around and find that there is nothing </p>
<p>k49 7:30 to the Union Building, go to Home, and learn that you can enter the room at 8 o’clock, store your school bags, and go downstairs to the company<br>I went in from AB and found that someone was practicing Taijiquan. Anyway, Dai Yingdu came, after watching for a while, he went up and talked about practicing Chen’s boxing. When asked about a sense of air, I said that my fingers swelled a bit when I opened it, and then I pulled other people’s thoughts, and I was said to be wrong o(╯□╰)o </p>
<p>Just in time for the rain, finding a house is generally running in the rain<br>But after I paid the deposit for Shenma, the house started and the rain stopped… </p>
<p>I’ve known that it’s very clean, and I feel so when I get off the train.<br>But it just feels so<br>Until I saw two girls walking barefoot on the road…<br>If you are in Hefei, blood dripping is a must… </p>
<p>Kawaii once said to buy sandals, but never felt<br>The net shoes were all soaked when I went out one morning<br>I saw the two girls at that time<br>Suddenly my mind changed, and later I discovered that many people wear slippers<br>It seems that the beach pants + flip-flops of the uncle-level programmers are not false. </p>
<p>I can’t use online banking on my computer to buy train tickets<br>This phenomenon occurs in Brother Hao’s house. At that time, he bought it smoothly after switching to his computer.<br>I thought it was a problem with IE9, resetting to reset the initial state, no<br>Helpless to reinstall the system<br>But it seems that the mirroring is wrong, and the blue screen is directly…<br>And the wooden belt system restores the USB flash drive, so I can’t help asking JS for the system drive<br>Originally, I thought that the company was originally IT, and the system disk was a must. I thought there was a small IT department inside. </p>
<p>Buying tickets for Jiaxing this time delayed me for most of the day. In the end, my sister bought them for me.<br>This kind of regional bank doesn’t work well if it goes out of the region. Of course, as long as I stay in Anhui peacefully, Huizhou Bank can comfortably say that I don’t blame it or blame it. </p>
<p>It’s strange to be out for the first time<br>In the afternoon, I was still taking Level 6 exams, I was in Hangzhou after I slept at night, and I am going to Jiaxing again today.<br>For places I haven’t been to, it always feels like an unexplored map in a real-time strategy game. It’s dark, and the map can only be lighted up when I pass. </p>
<p>Ran to many places to see the house paper<br>I would like to thank Ying Children’s Shoes and Wearing Children’s Shoes for helping me find room paper in Hangzhou, where I am unfamiliar. Especially when I was wearing children’s shoes, the room paper was already set, and I continued to accompany me on the road. With the constant urging of my girlfriend, I got to the penultimate room paper. </p>
<p>In the end, at a high price of 1100, I rented a room with a TV, a signal, a wooden floor, a screen window, a mattress, a table and chair, a living room and a living room far away from the company… </p>

    <title>FEEL Training</title>
    <url>/FEEL-Training/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="first-day"><a href="#first-day" class="headerlink" title="first day"></a>first day</h2><p>On the first day of the training, executives took turns to introduce them.<br>First time I met a real CEO COO CTO CFO<br>It’s rather embarrassing to have lunch at noon, and it looks like a private room reserved for executives. As a result, all the executives went back, and a few people went in. Fortunately, some colleagues came one after another.<br>After signing the contract in the afternoon, I went to my place.<br>Next to the window, there is a big gap between the curtains. The scorching sun spreads on my LCD monitor without any obstacles, and I can’t see anything…<br>Of course, it turned out that I was not the worst. The worst was our boss, who was directly told by another colleague that he was here to bask in the sun… </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Install the computer, remove the anti-virus tyrant, and configure it to your usual environment.<br>Of course, the company’s internet speed is too slow… Go back and copy some large software.<br>Then, I saw sister You. Mu thought of knowing me. After chatting for a while, the entire browser department had a small meeting. </p>
<p>Alas, this sentence is too witty. Everyone is technical, so silent, I am speechless.<br>I went back to the boss and assigned a task. After a while, I saw that it was past 6 o’clock. Isn’t it off work? Because there is no movement around Shenma? Asked in the group, it turned out that everyone was struggling with getting off work.<br>I had no choice but to stand still. At 20, I saw the instructor flashed. The mentor, I had to follow his footsteps, said hello to the boss, and ran back~ </p>
<h2 id="the-next-day"><a href="#the-next-day" class="headerlink" title="the next day"></a>the next day</h2><p>Randomly divided into teams, gave the team name and slogan<br>How to sum up their opinions when first encountered<br>In the end we decided on Bubble Fish / I am Bubble Fish, I love Bubble Fish as the team name and slogan<br>(On the third day I saw a cute clown fish, I brought it to play, and took a closer look at the “bubbling fish”, stupid, such a coincidence?)<br>Poster: Y+ for UI is a cow, a few bubbling fish are painted vividly, very Q </p>
<p>The various processes are intricate and complicated. I guess the one I can use is the administration department-there is only one drawer key. </p>
<p>In the end, the imitation was too much. I feel that it is not a problem of observation, but a misunderstanding of thinking. I have read a lot of thinking books, but I still see it.<br>Or where xi is good at this kind of problem, it is the first one to get it done. </p>
<h2 id="Third-day"><a href="#Third-day" class="headerlink" title="Third day"></a>Third day</h2><p>Time is getting tighter and tighter. Yesterday there was still some free time. I ran back to configure the development environment, and it was gone today.<br>Let’s draw the SKY logo, everyone will<br>The original purpose is to let everyone know to abide by the norms </p>
<p>Then I gave some random pictures and typeset out a newspaper<br>I thought about buying Apple. Fortunately, our group didn’t start the discussion. After finding that other groups also used this, we decided to give up<br>There are some sensitive issues, Xiaodong said don’t mention it, then forget it </p>
<p>Sister Yang Yang posted 10 questions, which will be changed into a sketch to perform in the evening, and then the questions will be inserted.<br>Have a quick meal at noon and collect answers to questions<br>It didn’t take long for the afternoon training time<br>Claiming to be a brainwashing training, among which the YY video on the mobile Internet, I really want to be born a hundred years later<br>The group was assigned to perform innovatively, and we adopted Yuan’s opinion.<br>Even though Brother Yuan is a small MM, he is very open and passionate.<br>Zhao Yang is really talented as a host. He used a lot of nonsense to fill the scene during the whole process.<br>Xiaodong keeps saying that he can’t do well, but he did well on the spot<br>I’m the referee, it’s pure soy sauce~ </p>
<p>Then we only have one hour to discuss the evening sketch<br>Brother Yuan has always been a more active thinking person. Later in the process of discussion, I finally found out that I was really not a post-90s, not a brain-disabled person. </p>
<p>Until the first group came on the field, we still did not determine the final ending, this is the place to pay attention to next.<br>The overall performance of the sketch is very good, just under the middle card. </p>
<p>At this time, I saw “Don’t live in other people’s world”. I went out and drank some water. I just ran into two school recruits who had been intern for a long time. One of them had a meal, said hello, and then I sat down and had a chat. The other kept asking me about the situation in Hefei and which university.<br>Of course it is China Other University. After saying it twice, they both looked confused, which caused my confidence to drop sharply, and my oral English still failed…<br>What surprised me was that Hang Dian was also a COU (just googled, and it was not. Of course, such NB schools don’t need this stuff, which is fundamentally different from mine).<br>I said that most of our schools find jobs locally, usually about 2k or so. He curled his lips. After I thought about it, he probably forgot about the low prices in Hefei.<br>Then JS came over and learned that Baidi’s library could borrow books on Friday.<br>After playing Wii, I went back to the classroom, dizzy, is the show over… </p>
<p>After everything was over, Sister Yang Yang said…<br>…<br>Well, sure enough time is tighter. Let’s roughly talk about the distribution of marketing planning. After all, it was so late and dissolved. </p>
<p>When I arrived at the gate, I ran into Brother Yuan and told me to take the parcel. Anyway, it’s already so late, and in the mansion garden, I’ll follow along and have a look.<br>Walking with this kind of girl paper makes me feel more dangerous.<br>After walking around for a long time, she finally found Yunda Point and learned that she had been taken away by someone she knew.<br>Now what happened to me, flash. </p>
<p>The first taxi never stopped! Sister, after getting on the second car, I told the driver that the front was refused? Seeing my face was silent, he also explained the previous one for a long time, to the effect that I would stop complaining. Alas, I’m actually tired, so just put it this way, how can I make a complaint? </p>
<p>I have to do laundry when I come back. There are so many trivial things… </p>
<h2 id="Fourth-day"><a href="#Fourth-day" class="headerlink" title="Fourth day"></a>Fourth day</h2><p>Brother Hao can really say, just a few hours at a time, if my throat becomes hoarse prematurely<br>Later, I learned that I had been a lecturer and practiced before, no wonder<br>There is a thought storm, the use of iron clothes racks. The balance is not very good, you can use the score=total/10 algorithm to return to balance<br>Of course, the market is not fair. There are always monopolistic companies who have the final say. I told the group that you should not care about others too much.<br>Squatting, alas, Tai Chi only forgets this<br>Squatting is estimated to be less than two minutes, so it’s sour.<br>There is a small voice in my heart, I am an intellectual hero, who can’t recognize the position, and always try his best. If you fall, the team will be incomplete tomorrow.<br>I figured this out and jumped up immediately (I still have the strength to jump up…)<br>Before the board game in the evening, I ran into sister Yang Yang during dinner and helped her move something in the administration department.<br>Then ran to table tennis and rubbed two balls<br>The board game is a killing game, everyone plays well hi<br>Brother Yuan talks a lot, Barabara confused everyone<br>Help Y+ fix the wireless connection at night, wash and sleep </p>
<h2 id="Fifth-day"><a href="#Fifth-day" class="headerlink" title="Fifth day"></a>Fifth day</h2><p>After the training today, I carefully mentioned it to the boss, sitting and doing nothing, there is nothing to do with it.<br>The boss said immediately that Seng had already prepared the task, but he didn’t say anything.<br>(It turned out to be like this, T.T)<br>… </p>
<h2 id="Sixth-day"><a href="#Sixth-day" class="headerlink" title="Sixth day"></a>Sixth day</h2><p>West Lake Orientation<br>We set off at 6.50, and it takes about an hour and a half to get to the Broken Bridge.<br>I also met the captain on the bus, and Yanjiao was also on this bus… </p>
<p>The West Lake is too hot, the team bought some fans<br>Get the task and set off </p>
<p>The classic fragment of the legend of the new white lady, beautiful, beautiful, delicious food for foreign tourists to write “Hello, Hangzhou…” and other tasks<br>A large group of people greeted us, Yuan brother Yijia rushed up immediately<br>Well, the English is really intermittent, and I still rely on the tour guide to translate…<br>The dialogue between them can still be understood, but let me just say…<br>There was a short lady next to me, who seemed to be of the yellow race, and how old I was. She was struggling at the time, and finally finally said the first time to a foreigner for the first time and asked a comparatively 2 question “Where are you” from?”<br>US Australia or something<br>Then I don’t know what to say…It’s really dumb English… </p>
<p>The first task was blindfolded, the team stretched the 10-meter rope into a regular pentagon. </p>
<p>I started to use Xiaodong 1.78 as equal length and side length, leaving a lot of rope<br>In fact, the instructor didn’t make it clear, so there can be no more<br>Of course we all admit our own mistakes, and that neglect did not mention </p>
<p>At first I thought about measuring the angle by hand, 108.<br>Later I found that they are measuring the distance to the corners, which is more convenient and accurate </p>
<p>After we all think it is a regular pentagon, it ends<br>Before I took off the blindfold, I was still anxious. After all, I made it out of feeling.<br>After actually seeing the graphics, I took a sigh of relief. In my heart, I sighed that the cooperation is really amazing.<br>Finally we completed the first item with full marks </p>
<p>When I get to the museum, I strongly recommend going in and blowing on the air conditioner, cooldown, but some people are afraid that there is not enough time, and they may not be able to get out (囧), so everyone continues on the road </p>
<p>The second task guess the word </p>
<p>I haven’t reacted yet, Brother Yuan has already done both…<br>Ο \ _ \ _ Ο “…<br>My only contribution is: let them put the stuck one aside, continue to the next one, and finally use the elimination method to see if there is a breakthrough<br>In the end, we finished it in more than 3 minutes, but unfortunately we made two mistakes (we learned later that we have the highest correct rate and the shortest time) </p>
<p>The third task: Outsmart nuclear warheads </p>
<p>A square area with a side length of four meters, there is a cup inside. Use rope, rubber band, chopsticks, and straws to pour a bottle of water in and take out the cup. During the whole process, people cannot enter the area and ropes and other objects cannot fall to the ground. </p>
<p>My suggestion is to pierce two holes so that you only need to lift the bottle above the cup, although some water will spill out on the road<br>But they are afraid it will be slower<br>Later, I learned that the Qianjiang No. 7 group of Fanxi had used this method. Now think about it, this may be slower, but it can save time for tying the rope + pouring water.<br>Finally, we used the most traditional method, pouring water </p>
<p>Take out the cup<br>I want to wind it more, wind it in the opposite direction, and then pull it out. When I watch the video, another group of this method failed. Fortunately, they said it was unstable. Use a slip knot and rejected this plan.<br>Then I saw the captain fiddle with the chopsticks and rubber bands again, so I went over and asked him what he thought of it<br>Later, I guessed that I was seen by Brother Yuan holding the rubber band. She suddenly jumped over and yelled: “I know, I know” </p>
<p>Fold the N rubber bands together, pull them apart with four ropes, then wrap the quilt, loosen it, wait for the rubber bands to hoop the cup, lift it up slowly<br>Let’s listen! ! !<br>Then I immediately thought of some of the points to pay attention to. After all, the rubber bands have more elasticity. If the hoop cup is not matched well, the cup is more likely to fall.<br>Then it started<br>This time I am in charge of observing<br>Jepen seems to be a little nervous, the rope can’t relax, the cup shook<br>Our voices coordinated, and finally ended this last event with a full score </p>
<p>Catch the bus<br>Jepen said that the other groups have been completed and there is not enough time (without such incentives, there are still many groups that have not arrived after we went back)<br>We went back, but fortunately we didn’t go back…<br>Suddenly the bus came, and everyone rushed to the opposite side of the road (Xiaodong and I feel that life is still important, it is the slowest crossing the road)<br>The captain on the bus suddenly saw the phone number of a contact person at the last bus stop. I felt it necessary to say something, in case it was still there waiting for us.<br>After the call, I knew I had gone back… </p>
<p>your<br>I didn’t expect Sister Bobo to take the photo. It was really interesting<br>I saw myself standing there blindfolded, good 2 ah, let’s not say…<br>Yanjiao’s group used the method of squeezing a bottle to pour water into a cup two meters away in “Smart Nuclear Warhead”, and later wanted to climb trees<br>Some want to tie people up and hang them<br>Too NB </p>
<p>At last<br>I have no feeling for the ranking, as long as it is not the last<br>Of course we won the first place without a doubt<br>Go to grandma’s house in the evening, the first group meeting of the group, so happy<br>I saw Brother Yuan’s room paper </p>
<p>Thoughts<br>I have always been alone in the university. Although I know that teamwork is very important, I have never felt it. Last year’s interview said that the team was unfounded. In this training, I personally experienced the magic of teamwork, it’s really amazing… </p>
<p>The FEEL training is about to end. Although I’m tired every day, I really appreciate everyone of Bubble Fish, O(∩_∩)O Thank you </p>

    <title>Goodbye my university</title>
    <url>/Bye-my-college/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I remember that when I first arrived in Hangzhou last time, I saw this beautiful city with lots of vegetation and seemed to express it once…<br>This kind of place that took four years and felt free for the first time in my life, it is not enough to meet again…<br>Of course, I don’t have any awesome experience worth writing about. I have passed it plainly, just express my feelings. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>After I got down to Level 6 two days ago, I have finished this thing that has dragged on for 3.5 years.<br>I think college years, in my life, really passed </p>
<p>I remember one night, I dreamed of N many mosquitoes, which made me itchy. I thought to myself, this magical horse breaks my dream, it is more uncomfortable than a bone<br>Then I stood in the graveyard…<br>Although I warn myself not to be afraid, dream, just feel it, taste it.<br>Okay, I was persuaded, and then I wanted to run, where should I go?<br>Hmm, my parents are right next door, just run to them<br>Parents and home have always been our shelter from the wind after our injuries. </p>
<p>It’s a pity. Then I woke up and found myself alone. In the rented house, the next door was a stranger I had never met before.<br>Really left and grown up<br>Remember a sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Independence means greater social responsibility, freedom means more tolerance, liberation means more self-management, and growing up means more effort.<br>I can’t help but think of the phrase “The great ability comes great responsibility.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I have always yearned for independence and freedom, but when I really got here, at a certain moment, there was still a kind of “light sadness” as the boss described. </p>
<p>Turn to the topic<br>My university is more fun<br>When I entered school, it was the second school I always despised in high school<br>Seriously, after half a year, nothing has changed<br>I skipped classes in my sophomore year, and I got a major<br>When the junior never goes to class again, the whole school is a book </p>
<h2 id="Level-6"><a href="#Level-6" class="headerlink" title="Level 6"></a>Level 6</h2><p>Actually there is no such thing as passing or failing<br>And, after graduation, my personal feeling is that the certificates are all gone<br>However, it is a comfort to parents. (Originally, I thought that the last time my dad came, it was the last time he gave me RMB. This time, it seems that I can blackmail them again. O(∩_∩)O)<br>Moreover, it can be regarded as a draw to an end to his university career. </p>
<p>of course……<br>If they knew… </p>
<p>Remember J.K. Rowling said in a speech at the graduation ceremony of Harvard University: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot remember telling my parents that I was studying Classics; they might well have found out for the first time on graduation day. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In college, I arrived late, retired early, skipped class, cheated, missed a course, retaken, and confessed my faults…<br>Counting it down, it seems that except for scholarships and bursaries, I haven’t gotten a fight, and everything else is basically satisfactory. </p>
<p>Of course, cheating has always been something I despise and even disgusting. I can stick to the principle of 60.<br>The most interesting thing is that he also practiced the “two armies at war, the heart is the best” in the “Sun Tzu Art of War” and finally “the soldier who fails to fight without fighting.”<br>So when fighting this, I really don’t know what the situation is. The principle is “If a person does not offend me, I will not offend; if a person offends me, it depends on the situation.” </p>
<p>Other things that seemed impossible in the junior year were gradually completed in the last period of time. </p>
<p>There are also regrets: the brand does not sound, job hunting and future development cannot be used as a stepping stone; strategic planning is not so perfect due to horizontal vision restrictions, etc. </p>
<p>Oh, yes, there is one that I should complete:<br>Go to China University of Science and Technology </p>
<p>Although my school (omitted), but the geographical location is unique<br>There are two medical schools and two large shopping malls nearby<br>It is very convenient to go shopping and go shopping<br>So every time I get together, others come to me </p>
<p>The most important thing is not far from the University of Science and Technology of China<br>It’s a pity that I didn’t use it, or never thought of it </p>
<p>Always feel good about myself<br>At the same time, it seems that there has always been a deep inferiority complex<br>I remember in the earliest days, I didn’t even dare to enter other schools<br>Keep your head down when passing by, passing by </p>
<p>When I was running around for a meager salary in my senior year, I had to face this fact.<br>Every day I run the job fairs of HKUST, all kinds of hard work </p>
<p>But I suddenly found out that most of them are almost the same (ordinary people), the same being cut off, the same being rejected<br>But the awesomeness is different. In my opinion, for a god-like company, the offer comes at your fingertips and it is no pity to reject it. </p>
<p>Isn’t there a saying that the strength of an individual has nothing to do with the group.<br>And in the group, the average IQ drops down. </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>I thought I would really leave in the future, and I never went home for more than a week<br>Decided to stop looking for an internship and stay with my parents quietly for a period of time<br>In the last two months, let me go out every day (Sang Xin)<br>Mom and Dad said that I stayed at home every day, didn’t go out, didn’t help with housework, and didn’t do anything, so I played games and went to bed in a daze.<br>In fact, during that time, I felt that I knew more than the previous three years<br>The most important thing is mental growth<br>I am very happy to see this magical world towards the end of the university<br>It’s a pity that it passed in a blink of an eye, and now I don’t have time to calm down and spend a long time studying. </p>
<p>Finally back to Hefei, nothing else, just to reply<br>We got together one last time, before I bid farewell to Hefei </p>
<p>Looking back at that time now, I am very moved<br>Not alone when I left </p>
<h2 id="in-case"><a href="#in-case" class="headerlink" title="in case"></a>in case</h2><p>I know that “if” is useless. It is repeatedly emphasized in mental books. It is a waste of time. It is better to focus on the present<br>Li Zongren said that if people live not from 1 to 80, but from 80 to 1 year old, 2/3 of people will become great men. </p>
<p>Just like in “The Gang of Men”, if time can be returned, I think it will be another ending </p>
<p>So, although I have no big regrets<br>But if I were to be in the last university, I would shorten the time and advance it half a year<br>After all, the higher the level, the tighter the time<br>Just went to college, suddenly liberated, madness is a must<br>The Warcraft game I have been playing crazy for a year, in fact, should be compressed to half a year, in the freshman year, I played crazy<br>Then get into programming, something more interesting than Warcraft<br>Get C in the sophomore year, look at the data structure<br>The junior finds a house and moves out of school. Go to the internship<br>Run a job fair two months before the senior year<br>Stay with your parents in the next time<br>Go out in the middle, fun, good-looking, pass the driver’s license<br>You can ask your parents to borrow funds (note that it is “borrowing”) </p>
<p>Of course, there is another possibility. If that guy was me now, it would be completely different today…<br>People’s cognition is always confined to the present, and looking back a few years later will only feel so naive and lack of thinking at the time. </p>
<p>Of course, of course, no if… </p>
<p>There is a path dependence theory in economics. It says that once people make a certain choice, it is like embarking on a path of no return. The force of inertia will make this choice constantly self-reinforcing and prevent you from walking easily. Get out. </p>
<p>Regardless of the original choice, it is a decision made by yourself, and you are responsible for yourself </p>
<p>After graduating, I suddenly felt that the possibility has dropped a lot. After all, there are certain things that have become established facts, and I cannot do it again.<br>Then suddenly I saw the old A in “Soldier Assault” and said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>twenty two? I see you like 70! …If I were you, I would definitely participate. Do you know why? Because I’m only 30, such a fun thing, I haven’t done enough yet<br>Yeah, I’m only 22, what a good number 22, a stupid age </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, don’t work, be hated, love someone. </p>
<p>I hope that after a few years, I look back again,<br>It’s not “Anything that doesn’t work well now has a time when it’s not working hard.”<br>It is “a little bit of a dream that is built, and you in the future will be grateful for your hard work now!” </p>
<p>Thousands of words, I can’t say enough, but there is a time to end </p>
<p>Goodbye, my university. </p>

<p>PS：<br>The hearts are mixed together, crumpled into pieces </p>
<p>Write and delete, delete and write<br>Save the draft, intermittently several times<br>Still out of place </p>
<p>I want to cry, but I feel like I am no longer a child </p>
<p>How many four years in life<br>Still have enough free time, four years of worry-free food and clothing </p>
<p>After that, we must constantly compromise between ideal and reality<br>As we grow older, we have a deeper understanding of society, as the feeling of powerlessness and paleness increases day by day, and gradually disappears </p>
<p>However, what I saw is a comfort to myself: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that in this radiant, rapidly changing living space, everyone has their own choice. My idea is very simple. I don’t have to wear beautiful clothes, and I don’t need to use rouge powder. The most serious, simple and active life is for me. Fascinated by the truth. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Education in China belongs to atheism and believes in science<br>But science can’t explain it at present, where does the realization come from? Is it just the activity of brain matter? Why do other animals have no will, but only humans? Can will exist without matter? Is everything really empty when you die? What are we doing here? </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>The reality is cruel. If depth first is used, the prerequisite is “God Mode”<br>Otherwise, it is often broken, and there is no chance to come back because of the time arrow </p>
<p>Reading, studying, knowing more information, and then using breadth first </p>
<p>But first determine the purpose and ask yourself what the soul wants<br>It says in “A Dialogue with God” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The soul, body, and brain are separate, and the soul is independent of the existence of the other two. All suffering is caused by the inconsistent purpose of the two. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the soul mentioned here is free will </p>
<h2 id="Free-will"><a href="#Free-will" class="headerlink" title="Free will"></a>Free will</h2><p>Actually more curious about free will<br>If Everett’s parallel universe hypothesis is true, then free will is a joke<br>Because no matter what choice you make, at the moment you choose, the world is divided into two, which is choice, and there is no choice.<br>Even birth and death<br>On a macro scale, there is no difference </p>
<p>However, for the individual, a choice is indeed made. Here is a quote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why do we like coins, because at the moment they are thrown into space, the answer is already obvious.” Except for the obvious authoritative answer, the answer is often in oneself, but the physical, mental, and insight are still not strong enough to be unnecessary Reason/cognition, can purely follow the heart. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe in free will, at least, after you choose, this world will continue for you, and your choice will affect your journey in this world. </p>
<p>Therefore, how to choose can have an optimal solution </p>
<h2 id="Optimal-solution"><a href="#Optimal-solution" class="headerlink" title="Optimal solution"></a>Optimal solution</h2><p>The optimal solution is another problem<br>What is the optimal solution?<br>This is inseparable from one’s worldview, outlook on life, and values </p>
<p>There is an article on Fai Mo: Nine Steps to Determine Your Life Goal and Make a Plan to Reach it<br>But the key is that one’s world outlook, outlook on life, and values will also change…<br>The Ship of Theseus can illustrate this very well </p>
<h2 id="The-Ship-of-Theseus"><a href="#The-Ship-of-Theseus" class="headerlink" title="The Ship of Theseus"></a>The Ship of Theseus</h2><ol>
<li>If you look at the different types of cells in the human body, the average age of the cells in the entire human body is about 7-10 years old. (That is to change all of them) </li>
<li>If a ship travels long distances at sea, it will inevitably be damaged, so the skilled craftsmen on board regularly replace part of the ship to maintain the normal navigation of the ship. A few years later, all parts of the entire ship were replaced. Is this ship still the same ship when it started? If so, then if the discarded parts are collected and reassembled into a ship, what is the relationship between the two ships and the original ship when they set off? If not, when did this ship become different from the original? </li>
</ol>
<p>This question is very fascinating. If you count it this way, it’s almost 3 rounds. </p>
<p>The above only talks about the physical situation, if you add the education, the environment, and the past experience </p>
<p>Therefore, at each stage, the pursuit is different<br>I admire those who have “one sword in ten years”<br>“Ten Thousand Hours of Genius Theory”, 3 hours a day is almost ten years </p>
<p>Ten years of sharpening a sword ]Source】<br>Tang Jiadao’s “Swordsman” poem: “Ten years to sharpen a sword, and frost blade has never tried. Today is like a king, who is injustice?” (Ten years? coincidence?) </p>
<p>Is there any way when this kind of purpose changes from time to time and cannot be rolled back? </p>
<h2 id="how-are-you"><a href="#how-are-you" class="headerlink" title="how are you"></a>how are you</h2><p>Greedy algorithm is a simpler and faster design technique for some optimal solution problems. The characteristic of using the greedy method to design an algorithm is to proceed step by step. It is often based on the current situation to make an optimal choice according to an optimization measure, without considering all possible overall situations, it saves the need to find the optimal solution. All possible and must spend a lot of time, it adopts top-down, iterative method to make successive greedy choices, every time a greedy choice is made, the problem is reduced to a smaller sub-problem, and through each step Greedy selection can obtain an optimal solution to the problem. Although each step must ensure that a local optimal solution can be obtained, the resulting global solution is sometimes not necessarily optimal, so do not go back in the greedy method. </p>
<h2 id="At-last"><a href="#At-last" class="headerlink" title="At last"></a>At last</h2><p>A favorite sentence, which also happens to be about choice: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are not just a random person meeting another, we are all through the mountains and rivers, slowly and long way to find each other, in our human growth river, this short moment of cause and fate, it is not accidental, it is ours select. </p>

<p>What we can do now is to find a quiet place, let ourselves think quietly, and understand how to do it, so that we can prevent precious things and important people from losing again, and understand how to do it.

<a id="more"></a>

<p>In the first two weeks, I got up at 6 o’clock and went to bed at 11 o’clock every day. I felt very energetic. It’s not a problem to work 16 hours a day.<br>The side effects came out<br>I didn’t work overtime for these two days, I was nestled in my house without internet, and I deeply realized the terrible loneliness.<br>Become inexplicably irritable, unfortunately the mobile phone can be connected to the Internet, so harassment everywhere<br>The most common one is Gu Xiaobai’s “So boring, so boring” in “The Gang of Men”<br>Sorry for causing trouble to some people. As for when it will stabilize, I don’t know </p>
<h2 id="007-and-the-Grand-Master"><a href="#007-and-the-Grand-Master" class="headerlink" title="007 and the Grand Master"></a>007 and the Grand Master</h2><p>In college, every once in a while, I would go to the theater to watch big movies<br>I didn’t have any money at that time, and I was only willing to go once because it was an international blockbuster + 3D<br>Work, but left these entertainments behind </p>
<p>I went to watch “007” the other night<br>Very worried </p>
<p>I came out and remembered the comment of verycd “Assassin’s Creed”: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>After going in for a while, I felt a sense of desolation. Although the city is more prosperous and the characters are more gorgeous, but facing Ezio, who is more than half a century old, it is a desolate time. From the beginning of the second generation, the young and young hairy boy to this one. The old man with a gray face and beard climbing the wall has a lot of thoughts. A few days ago, it happened that I also celebrated my birthday. It feels that year after year is getting faster and more like this game, I am already old when I look at myself in a blink of an eye<br>A person’s life is vividly revealed in this assassin trilogy </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The Great Master” has many touches, so I won’t talk about them one by one.<br>The most touching point:<br>Ip Man went to break the cake in Haneda’s hand, and couldn’t handle it.<br>Mr. Accountant commented that Tai Chi Yang Luchan has the stunt of “the bird does not fly”. The bird stopped in Yang Luchan’s palm and it could not fly, because Yang Luchan’s tricks made the bird nowhere to focus. Was locked in an invisible cage. </p>
<p>I specifically checked this story, here </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The little sparrow was alive and kicking, but it looked like a sick leg in the palm of the martial arts master Yang Luchan. Although he kept flapping his wings, it was caught by magnetism, squeaking, and unable to fly. If you want to fly, your feet must be balanced on the point of effort, and you can use the rebound force to lift your wings to fly. Yang Luchan’s kung fu has reached the peak of perfection, and the palm can feel the momentary thrust of the sparrow’s legs, whenever a sparrow When he kicked his legs to fly, he sank his palms, and the bird’s kicking force was wiped out! Therefore, the little sparrow could only flutter his wings and struggle, and could not do without Yang Luchan’s palm.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story may be exaggerated, but whether it is true or not, it arouses my interest in continuing Tai Chi </p>
<p>In parks, middle-aged and elderly people usually practice the 24 styles of the national standard. It evolved from the Yang family and is actually Tai Chi.<br>There is a piece of history here, it’s more sensitive, so I won’t talk about it. You can adapt it by google Tai Chi yourself </p>
<p>Seeing such softness + weakness in my freshman year, I suddenly had no idea<br>Later, it was discovered that the Yang family was actually evolved from the Chen family, and the Chen family can be vocal when fighting. It is super suitable for young people, and my physical fitness has been poor. </p>
<p>However, from the initial fastness to the present slowness, I realized how powerful Yang’s “rigid and softness is contained, but hidden deep.”<br>My understanding is that Yang has already externalized and embodied Wangsijin, without seeing the slightest on the outside. Jin circling and flipping inside, and once you get your hands on it, it’s done… </p>
<p>I used to sit on the well and watch the sky again </p>
<h2 id="It-took-me-eighteen-years-to-sit-with-you-and-drink-coffee"><a href="#It-took-me-eighteen-years-to-sit-with-you-and-drink-coffee" class="headerlink" title="It took me eighteen years to sit with you and drink coffee"></a>It took me eighteen years to sit with you and drink coffee</h2><p>Every time I see Xue Yuan, I count how much money I have taken and how much I have saved now, and every time it counts too much, it makes me think that I have realized my dream in a few years. </p>
<p>This is quite speechless, and only a little bit more. What’s the use? Life is a mess, wandering on the edge of pessimism and anxiety<br>In fact, what I want to say is, why are there so many more for no reason? How much do you need to pay for this<br>An article that impressed me a lot so far:<br>“It took me eighteen years to sit and drink coffee with you” </p>
<p>My university is china other university, which is already weak<br>At the stage of school recruitment, it was the first time to face the students from the other two schools, and felt helpless. </p>
<p>J.K. Rowling’s speech at the graduation ceremony of Harvard University:<br>The Fringe Benefits of Failure, and the Importance of Imagination (“The benefits of failure and the importance of imagination”)<br>There is a sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person’s idea of success, so high have you already flown academically. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I have always envied those students from prestigious schools. I envy their starting point, which is already so high.<br>How many times does it take to catch up with them, and it’s just possible </p>
<p>Every stage has troubles at every stage<br>I don’t know if I see a little bit more, but because of this, it makes me miserable<br>Because of that, I know how big the gap is, and I feel helpless to my weak self.<br>Every thing, every direction, it takes time to do </p>
<p>I don’t want myself as a Weibo complained: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too late to figure out what I want, the temples have begun to turn white; too late to be sure of their love, the other side is already married; too late to love the child, he has grown up and left you; too late to become famous, we are about to enter The grave is gone. We are afraid that everything is too late </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the second has already been fulfilled </p>
<p>Become the kind of person you hated most when you were young<br>When a person chooses to grow up, he often chooses not to be understood, because you have to take the path you choose, not the path they think you should choose.<br>I don’t know if at this stage, mom and dad don’t know what I’m thinking anymore<br>Actually I don’t know what I’m thinking, let alone others<br>And, a while ago, I found that I was becoming someone I didn’t like<br>Everything is cautious, not dare to expose who you are<br>As one sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The loss of many people is against their aspirations when they were young. I think I am mature, skilled, shrewd, naive in the past, I finally see it through and want to wear it. So, we became the kind of people we hated most when we were young </p>
</blockquote>
<p>not happy things<br>When I’m sad, no one cares about me<br>I feel dizzy when I see a full screen of English<br>The number of books you want to read is as many as the PM in the Imperial Capital </p>
<p>The theory knows:<br>Take your time, everything is too late<br>Where is weak, where is it<br>Do only one thing at a time<br>Power of the moment<br>Assigned task, the most difficult thing in the world </p>
<p>It seems to be on the road of self-salvation<br>However, the weak burst like this, and sometimes I really feel hopeless </p>
<p>Half a year after graduation<br>It’s been half a year<br>The end of the world is over </p>
<p>Objectively speaking, there seems to be progress<br>But the curve drawn is infinitely close to the horizontal line </p>
<p>Chao Wendao </p>
<p>There is another place that makes me very depressed </p>
<p>In Da Liu’s science fiction, there is an article called “The Way of the Chaos”,<br>Quoting from “The Analects of Confucius Liren”<br>It gives a detailed description of scientists willing to give their lives in order to understand the mysteries of the universe. </p>
<p>Although there is a sequence of hearings, it is nothing more than a big deal. </p>
<p>But there is a sentence in the Tao Te Ching: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sergeant hears the Tao and walks diligently; the sergeant hears the Tao, if it survives; the corporal laughs when he hears the Tao. Not smiling is not enough. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not smiling, not enough<br>The obvious feeling is that I saw the book “Poor Dad” in my sophomore year in the library. I flipped through it at the time. When it came to the coining section, it felt boring. I thought that I would not do business by myself anyway. In the future, I will use programming as my career and narrow my goals, so I won’t spend time looking at this </p>
<p>Now it seems ridiculous how stupid it was at that time, it can be said that the Tao is right in front of me, but I turn a deaf ear to it </p>
<h2 id="Superego-ego-and-id"><a href="#Superego-ego-and-id" class="headerlink" title="Superego, ego and id"></a>Superego, ego and id</h2><p>Everyone lives in three states of yourself: parent, adult, and child.<br>They correspond to the personality structure of Freud: the superego, the ego and the id.<br>The superego represents the law, morality, conscience, authority, the defender of order, the strict prosecutor, the god, the god, the enlightened Zen master, and the principle of perfection.<br>The id following the principle of happiness is all primitive impulses, instincts and desires, willful, do whatever one wants, and self-centered.<br>The self follows the principles of reality, the coordinator and the balancer, he is in the middle, not only to satisfy the desire of the self, but also to escape the eyes of the prosecutor, and cannot completely violate the will of the superego. The ego is like a businessman, and can be bargained; the id and the superego are at the two ends of the seesaw, and the ego is in the middle, so they need to be balanced. The self is rational and follows the principles of reality. </p>
<p>Why am I so sad, everything, I think, may be the super-ego too awesome </p>
<p>I have always had a shadow in my heart, that is, in all the fields I know, programming, Tai Chi, meridian, psychology, mind, and recently finance has achieved great success and peaked me.<br>I have never had a conversation with him directly, there is always only one shadow<br>As said in “God, Xueba, Man”, “God is not a bird of us”<br>But I have been trying to control my desire carefully, chasing after the shadow </p>
<p>There are a lot of trivial things and I don’t have time to listen to inner voice<br>And most of the time, I am satisfied with my choice<br>But a person, at home, closes the doors and windows, all around you are lonely, and when you are alone<br>Will face the godlike opponent of the superego and the piglike ally of the self </p>
<p>Only to realize that I was so fragile, even cowardly and crying<br>No pain no gain, but sometimes I wonder if the price is too great, what is it to toss about? It’s better to live a small life peacefully, why not be happy </p>
<p>How to balance the gap<br>I think that all the powerlessness and sorrow come from this </p>

    <url>/For-2012/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I still have a hindsight. It was originally a New Year’s Day summary. It was delayed until the Spring Festival, and then today. </p>
<h2 id="Written-in-2012"><a href="#Written-in-2012" class="headerlink" title="Written in 2012"></a>Written in 2012</h2><p>I was restless a month before the Spring Festival<br>I don’t know if it has something to do with a person outside<br>When I went home during the Chinese New Year, I looked at the snow flying in the sky and the earth wrapped in silver on the bus, and my heart returned to peace. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>2012 was the year I grew the most<br>Leaving aside the changes in the external environment, we can no longer use students’ standards to demand ourselves </p>
<p>In the first half of the year, I had nothing to do, read books and played games at home<br>Remember the godlike work “Take Time as a Friend”<br>The heart is eager, and I read it intermittently for a month<br>After that, the world feels different<br>Probably since then, fell in love with reading </p>
<h2 id="Overkill"><a href="#Overkill" class="headerlink" title="Overkill"></a>Overkill</h2><p>I still remember the process of Tai Chi from rigid to soft in my sophomore year. I chatted with my teacher once<br>He said that I was shaking too hard, and asked my classmates to take a video with their mobile phones, and I would understand by looking at them.<br>I was stunned and said, I thought this was the only way to go. </p>
<p>Yes, this is overkill </p>
<p>I also felt back pain when I was in high school<br>I have been exposed to traditional medicine since then<br>But recently I felt pain in my limbs and neck pillow<br>I heard a sentence in Dongwu’s Theory of Relativity, “When you realize his existence, it may be a problem.”<br>I thought it was more serious and wondered if I was going to die<br>But recently I saw it in “The Art of Learning”, it may also be an introduction to Tai Chi, and I felt something I didn’t feel before<br>In short, everything goes on and stays calm </p>
<h2 id="At-a-glance"><a href="#At-a-glance" class="headerlink" title="At a glance"></a>At a glance</h2><p>Sometimes it’s so strange, you can notice her at a glance when you are in a crowd<br>Even if it’s not the first sight, after a while, in the vast crowd, you will notice this person<br>Just seeing it can distinguish her from the people around her<br>Background, personality, occupation, hobbies are all unknown, but you can still feel her special </p>
<p>Go to the Westside Ice Rink on Saturday, this is the second time in my life skating<br>Like skating<br>One is to make yourself feel the difficulties of being an upright animal again and train your cerebellum<br>The second is to re-understand the balance, this and Tai Chi should have a complementary effect<br>So decided to make it a constant for weekend sports<br>At present, friction is still used for steering, and I hope to use centripetal force next time </p>
<h2 id="impetuous"><a href="#impetuous" class="headerlink" title="impetuous"></a>impetuous</h2><p>Everyone is saying that this is an impetuous society </p>
<p>Yes, the general trend<br>There is a saying: If you live in an abnormal place for a long time, you will regard the abnormality as justified. </p>
<p>I do not deny that I am impetuous<br>I want to do everything, I didn’t get into anything<br>But I feel helpless. Reading and paying attention only started from the senior year.<br>Knowing GTD, what’s the use<br>The key is the quality of time usage, not the quantity<br>flow- heart flow, time stops for you </p>
<p>The same is true for impetuousness, I feel like how to deal with a deep and broad relationship<br>First wide-ranging, as Qiao said, keep trying to discover, and eventually, you will find your interest<br>I have been struggling with programming for two years in the university. I naively thought it was a lifetime thing.<br>And thought that as long as you are called a master or a great person, you don’t have to worry about money<br>And claim to work for interest, not money<br>Look now, it was so silly and naive<br>In the carefree four years of college, I didn’t make it wide. Although it’s a bit late now, I still have to continue to do this. </p>
<h2 id="Moving"><a href="#Moving" class="headerlink" title="Moving"></a>Moving</h2><p>Thank you to those friends in Hefei (I turned out to be disgusted with this term, but later found out that there is another meaning, Chinese culture is really broad and profound), I used to pull you out every time I was sad.<br>And stay with me for a while<br>Who else, when I learned that I had five subjects and retaken one, did not get a bachelor’s degree in psychology, did not enter a graduate school, out of desperation for a humble salary and rushed around, and prepared the day before my birthday When you are hit and sad and messed up, there is no disgust but comfort </p>
<h2 id="Sanshengshi"><a href="#Sanshengshi" class="headerlink" title="Sanshengshi"></a>Sanshengshi</h2><p>Just listening to the name is awesome </p>
<p>The first contact was in “Sou Shen Ji”: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lie on the three-life stone, realize the past and next lives, drink the worry-free spring water, and forget the grudges </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last time I visited Hangzhou and I googled Hangzhou attractions, I found three words “Sanshengshi” </p>
<p>At the end of my 22-year-old, there were many things that deviated from my vision<br>And I found that everything I did was probably avoiding (what to avoid?) </p>
<p>The most depressing thing is that after a sleep, the brain recompiles and runs everything according to what it wants. </p>
<p>When I woke up, I found myself sleeping very deep and relaxed, just like the time when I heard Zhao tell me I have BL in my junior year. </p>
<p>Then I went to see the Sanshengshi, not for anything else, after all, it’s my name to remove the life. </p>
<h2 id="Utility-and-freedom"><a href="#Utility-and-freedom" class="headerlink" title="Utility and freedom"></a>Utility and freedom</h2><p>Understand true liberalism, understand the role of inheritance tax, </p>
<p>I understand that I may not have independent views, and there is a huge gap between critical thinking and critical thinking. </p>
<p>I understand that since “Happiness Lesson”, I feel so good about myself, and even overcorrected </p>
<p>Understand that you still can’t make promises to others, no matter who that person is </p>
<p>I understand that in order not to disappoint myself or others, I frequently choose not to act </p>
<p>Understand that sometimes opportunities are used to wait and change, the final result is lost </p>
<p>I understand that once I get frustrated, I still feel sad </p>
<p>But I still don’t understand, what when where who why how </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel that everything I do is just a small mess, so what if I change it, I still feel a sense of powerlessness </p>
<p>Yuyu stream bottom pine, seedlings from the mountain<br>In the diameter of the stem, shade this hundred feet </p>
<p>Wan said she recently discovered that if you work hard, you will achieve it </p>
<p>But my model is, it may not be realized, at least there will be many gaps between the real result and my own modeling </p>
<h2 id="hope"><a href="#hope" class="headerlink" title="hope"></a>hope</h2><p>Of course, I think, maybe they are just trying to excuse themselves and find a good-sounding reason for themselves<br>Of course, more likely, what I said is wrong<br>But in any case, no matter how you sigh, the wonderful 22 has passed.<br>Sometimes it feels like there is a clock, ticking on the alarm clock<br>Is it an inner time observation, but also the experience of the passage of time<br>It’s true, the dead are like husbands </p>
<p>I also know that hope does not matter whether there is or nothing<br>But I can’t help but hope that I’m on my way to the end of the third cycle.<br>I can make a breakthrough, just like the name of a Microsoft game: The Rise of the Country </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I want to write something, but I don’t know where to start </p>
<p>Probably entering the bottleneck period, I can’t feel any obvious changes </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>And no wonder there is a shift from blog to Weibo<br>There is no time to code a whole paragraph<br>Time is completely fragmented </p>
<p>And Shuangpin is finally getting smoother, except for tyu and other letters. Sometimes I don’t know it and I need to try it. Most of the time, it’s barrier-free<br>When I use Quanpin in the library, I obviously feel that there are too many subtitles to be tapped. </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Hangtu"><a href="#Hangtu" class="headerlink" title="Hangtu"></a>Hangtu</h2><p>The first time I went with Yiya in Lu’an<br>At that time, I was shocked. The bookshelf reached the ceiling, and I had to climb the shelf while holding the book. It felt like a Harry Potter movie.<br>I wanted to come often<br>Last May Day, I finally stayed for more than a long time, and I tried the topic reading (in fact, parallel reading is not considered at best)<br>Let’s not talk about the reading effect, just take out the relevant books and brush off N of them. It’s quite fulfilling, don’t be too cool. </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="weekend"><a href="#weekend" class="headerlink" title="weekend"></a>weekend</h2><p>We don’t know what changes can bring us, but we know exactly what we will lose<br>No wonder always avoiding and avoiding<br>I ran to Shanghai and Hefei last month, let alone the effect of relaxation, it is true that the card burst </p>
<p>I used to be a housekeeper on weekends, and I feel overkill again. It seems that I am always pushing myself.<br>The time schedule is full, like a real-time multitasking operating system, non-stop, the CPU is always fully loaded<br>The result is tired, and I don’t feel like a weekend at all. The most depressing thing is that it’s too divergent. I didn’t do everything well. When I’m free, I don’t know where to start. </p>
<p>If I feel a week this time<br>It seems that one day we must stay in the house without opening the door;<br>Must be delayed on Friday or Saturday until one or two in the morning<br>To find a little rest </p>
<p>But today I ran for another day<br>I saw Mechanic3 in the morning, and it was done by one person again, ha ha </p>
<p>I think Tony must also be thinking, take off that armor, what is he, “Iron Man”? What about other people wearing armor?<br>He always called himself Mechanic, but later he seemed to have found the answer. He became more determined and healed his anxiety. At the end he said “I’m ironman” </p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went to a place similar to the English corner and read the original “art of learning”<br>I have brushed Chinese before, but the result is still full of obstacles and tragedy </p>
<p>Staying up late, sleepy and not sleeping, no morals<br>But the night is quiet, everything in the day fades, and the feeling of powerlessness suddenly occurs. Is this person me? </p>
<p>Wang Xiaobo said that all human suffering is essentially anger towards his incompetence. </p>
<p>It’s right to be angry, it’s not right to be nervous to harass others, then who is sorry?<br>I will go for psychological consultation tomorrow afternoon. I have already made an appointment. </p>
<hr>
<h3 id="World-Book-Day"><a href="#World-Book-Day" class="headerlink" title="World Book Day"></a>World Book Day</h3><p>4.23 After turning over the Douban group, I knew it was World Book Day<br>Helpless to resuscitate too late, it is the first time in life to know<br>Remember that sentence </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was reborn because of 200 books, and I was born again because of 1000 books </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought that the fighting falcon I have been paying attention to, 1000+ is good enough<br>I just saw a broken 8k+ on Zhihu<br>For a moment, I thought I was dazzled<br>Then I thought it was extensive reading, and after seeing the number of notes, I collapsed<br>Ruin three views<br>Could it be the sweeping monk in “Dragon Babu”? </p>
<p>At first I thought it was a case, it is not universal<br>But the reality is cruel<br>It is sad to find that the broken k is calculated by heap<br>Are these people perverted? . . </p>
<p>I was not calm in an instant, I turned over the boxes and turned the cabinets, and marked all the books that I had read before, as long as they were books.<br>Thanks to the contribution of martial arts + fantasy, it instantly doubled, breaking through 200+, but unfortunately nothing has changed, and I have been a passerby since then.<br>Dedicated to today </p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Heart-to-heart-yet-independent"><a href="#Heart-to-heart-yet-independent" class="headerlink" title="Heart-to-heart, yet independent"></a>Heart-to-heart, yet independent</h3><p>There is a sentence in “Cang Hai”: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is no sweetheart by your side, even if there is a peerless light, what use is it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compared with Yingying in Kunlun, I prefer Hua Xiaoshuang, such an independent woman<br>Although I don’t know much about martial arts, I know exactly what I want and what I can do, kind, warm, and optimistic. </p>
<p>Like Shu Ting’s “To the Oak” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heart-to-heart, yet independent </p>
</blockquote>
<p>but </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes when I fell in love with someone, I was already broken in love. There was no confession, no holding hands, no hugs, none of them, but I felt that I had been in love for a long time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I know a little bit more than before<br>I have never crossed the mountain, I don’t know, my horizons are a bit broadened<br>But when I had a drink with the captain that time, I said, I know a little bit more, but is it useful? </p>
<p>like </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the later story, I have already missed the right time to meet the right person again. It is sad for me, and hurt for her. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am more liberal. I think respect provides a preparation for true love. Once that person appears, I will go all out<br>But when you think about it, why not deceive yourself<br>But what can I believe if I don’t believe it, I can only choose one, life is so helpless </p>
<hr>
<h3 id="To-our-dying-youth"><a href="#To-our-dying-youth" class="headerlink" title="To our dying youth"></a>To our dying youth</h3><p>The whole article is full of a touch of sadness, and I am also very sad when I read it. Alas, the university has never experienced this medicine<br>When I read it, I have already graduated, tragedy, I heard that the movie didn’t make the taste as it should be, I didn’t watch it, and I don’t want to be sang again.<br>When I returned to school after Qingming last time, I was a little envious of those students<br>I originally planned to go downstairs to the 14# dormitory to burn some paper for memorial service, but I gave up later<br>A passage I saw very early should be very general: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, I am quite envious of these tech nerds, mainly because of their lifestyle and unity. They can play World of Warcraft together, play Dungeons and Dragons board game, discuss women together, play anime together, and experience all kinds of joys in the world of men. Events, such a happy party, I’m afraid it’s only possible when you’re in college. After going to work, you have a career, that is, drinking and chatting together, all your hobbies may be renewed, because it will definitely delay your work. And life, so when you are happy, don’t blink, it’s 30 years. </p>

    <title>Feelings after joining the company for almost a year</title>
    <url>/Thinking-in-one-year-of-working/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>JUST DO IT<br>Just do IT, ha ha </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>One year after graduation, let’s write a little bit </p>
<p>Going to school was easy at the time, and I thought I liked programming<br>But I really liked it at that time. No one was in charge of the university and I went to watch it spontaneously.<br>Probably because of the influence of the book “Be the Best You”, I regarded the data structure and algorithm very importantly, and stupidly thought that the trainees were all floating clouds, and even suffered a lot later. </p>
<p>Analyzing now, it was also that the vision was too narrow at that time.<br>People have to be a little hobby, otherwise it is so empty<br>At that time, I only knew programming, and it should be a sustenance. If you don’t even like this, and you don’t have a girlfriend, this kind of life is terrible </p>
<p>After the offer was signed, I was immediately removed from school<br>In that year, I had nothing to do, and I looked around and found many wonderful things.<br>Discover that the world is so magical and discover that there are many possibilities<br>Why do I define myself as a program ape siege lion? </p>
<p>I joined later, and overall, it’s okay<br>Day by day, it’s like plain boiled water </p>
<p>At the beginning, I lived far away. Every day, “Time is like water in a sponge. If you want to squeeze, you can always get on the bus.”<br>Obviously the dung bucket of the ants, I feel sad to think about<br>Later moved to the company, in order to save money, the paper is relatively old<br>I’ve seen Daqiang for the first time in my life, it’s not just disgusting. </p>
<p>In terms of work, generally speaking, most of the time is not too busy. At first, I looked at iOS development in my spare time.<br>I got busy later, my personal time was squeezed infinitely </p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s my Jiangzi or the industry is Jiangzi<br>I feel a bit like a firefighter, wherever there is a fire, wherever I am caught<br>At first it was Android, then the boss asked me to take a look at iOS<br>(Insert: I think everyone who is accustomed to win, contacting Apple, will be shocked by its design, which is why I always want to buy an air or pro)<br>Okay, I watched it for about two weeks and said that the Android side is too busy. Let’s see Android.<br>Later, he was caught to compile the android project<br>Now I’m going to be caught writing a webpage again </p>
<p>Of course, I just vomit, anyway, I’m not interested in it anymore.<br>Whatever you need, just take a look at what you need, and what you can do at work becomes<br>Some people should say that it can’t be deep<br>Yes, I don’t know, but I really don’t want to see it<br>I’m really envious when I see a colleague gnawing on jvm </p>
<p>I don’t have language beliefs, I just laughed at that language ranking<br>It feels reasonable to exist, and every language is born to deal with specific problems<br>No language is particularly good, that language is particularly bad </p>
<p>Of course, there is always a problem of habit. I have always used C to learn programming. I hardened Java and found that it was really smooth. It was a language for people to look at. Eclipse is also more comfortable to use than VS+VA. The automatic prompt is really too powerful. Up<br>But two days ago, I looked up the Bisset of the year and I don’t know it at all. Is this something I wrote that year?<br>There is also the Linux kernel, version 0.11, and the 2w code is implemented. It is short and concise, which is incredible </p>
<p>Yes, time is like cleavage, there is always a squeeze<br>But those who do this should all understand. I can’t wait to fall asleep when I get home. I don’t even want to care about my girlfriend. Where can I get the energy to do other things, and it’s accompanied by delays.<br>Yes, ** “I often worry that I don’t have enough time, but I squander the little time I have.”** </p>
<p>After a major layoff, about a half of the people who left, many compatriots who joined the job at the time were recruited<br>I became the silent majority, clocking in and out of get off work, not talking gossip, and not communicating with people around me very much.<br>The project prospects are not optimistic. TL has already flashed, the new TL is very anxious, and the Yali is getting bigger and bigger<br>I used to think there were many opportunities here, and I wanted to jump into a better company in two years. Now look at which company to go to, it’s actually not much difference </p>
<p>I’m really tired now, I want to quit, find a place to rest<br>But it’s not as good as going to school, with parents covering </p>
<p>If you want to change careers as soon as possible, where should you go? </p>

    <title>How to learn Shuangpin</title>
    <url>/How-to-Learn-Shuangpin/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The first to know that Shuangpin is the era of smart ABC<br>At that time, the input status bar in the lower right corner had a “Quan Pin”, click it, it becomes Shuang Pin, try a few letters, I don’t know what happened.<br>Later, when the Sogou input method was in full swing, Pinyin input evolved to the second generation, which greatly accelerated the input speed of Pinyin, and Wubi was left out in the cold. </p>
<p>Usually when we think about something, what comes out of our mind is “sound” instead of Chinese characters.<br>So Pinyin is more in line with the speaking process than Wubi </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Later I tried Shuangpin, mainly because I saw a passage from Teacher Li Xiaolai’s “Take Time as a Friend”: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I really realized the benefits of taking notes while reading, or even taking a lot of notes, I was surprised that I was scared into a cold sweat by myself. I suddenly understood how ridiculous it was that I refused to practice blind typing in the past. At that time, even if there was no stimulation of the opposite sex, it would take at most a week to get things done. I turned out to be lazy and refused to learn and practice. If this thought made me get goosebumps, even if I spent a week learning touch typing 5 years ago, how many more reading notes and words can I accumulate? ——Not to mention that almost 15 years ago, I had the opportunity, and it was entirely possible to learn blind typing. My God, how much time did I waste? I dare not think about it anymore. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I started to check the information, it’s not difficult, everyone will understand after reading Baidu<br>After all, they are all in the Pinyin system, just like when I was a child, I spoke the hometown dialect, but then there is basically no obstacle to learning Mandarin. </p>
<p>Facing several problems: </p>
<h2 id="1-Speed"><a href="#1-Speed" class="headerlink" title="1. Speed"></a>1. Speed</h2><p>If it’s not for speed, the silly eggs will be replaced with Shuangpin </p>
<p>So where is Shuangpin fast?<br>for example:<br>I want to hit “Hello, Double Fight World”<br>The full spelling is <code>nihao,shuangpinshijie</code><br>Shuangpin is <code>nihk,udpnuijx</code> (the natural code I used)<br>This is only six characters, which reduces the number of keystrokes by 8 times. If you count 3k a day, it is also 4k times less. It is also beneficial to protect your fingers.<br>Of course you may say “I have super simple spelling”, <code>nh, spsj</code><br>Then I won’t talk about the duplicate code, you can turn the page to find it slowly<br>And Shuangpin is also Pinyin, so it makes no sense to not support Super Jianpin </p>
<h2 id="2-Cross-input-method"><a href="#2-Cross-input-method" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross input method"></a>2. Cross input method</h2><p>Quanpin, no matter which input method is used, the keys are exactly the same<br>There are several schemes for Shuangpin, the common ones are the following (you can see it in Sogou settings)<br>Sogou also has a Sogou plan </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Shuangpin.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I have checked before which scheme is more efficient<br>Children’s shoes that have not been touched don’t need to be tangled.<br>If you want to say that there is a real gap, you are only familiar with it </p>
<p>In addition, if you are not a coder, the one who is familiar with Microsoft is OK. After all, Microsoft’s reputation and the general input method QQ and Shenma support this. </p>
<p>If you use  family bucket and don’t want to install a third-party input method, use Sogou’s solution<br>This is the only one that supports both iPhone and Mac without jailbreak<br>The first natural code I used, but I had no choice but to change it to the Sogou solution 🤷‍♂️<br>Fortunately, the keys are almost the same, you will be familiar with it in a few clicks </p>
<p>Please continue </p>
<h2 id="3-Cross-platform"><a href="#3-Cross-platform" class="headerlink" title="3. Cross-platform"></a>3. Cross-platform</h2><p>I have played the dvorak keyboard before, and after a month of familiarization with the keys (the qwerty keyboard can only be typed blindly after a few months), I don’t know if it is a psychological effect, and I feel that the speed has indeed become faster, from the original 160 to 220 </p>
<p>Windows can implement the qwerty-&gt;dvorak key mapping by modifying the registry, but ubuntu can’t. In addition, mobile phones have become popular after sophomore year. It is very painful for the two keyboards to switch directly. I have no choice but to return to qwerty. </p>
<p>With the lessons learned from the past, we should be very careful when choosing a plan, in case any of them don’t support it. </p>
<p>In the end, the natural code was selected, whether it is ubuntu, mac, or even the QQ pinyin of android, there is this “natural code” </p>
<h2 id="Exercise"><a href="#Exercise" class="headerlink" title="Exercise:"></a>Exercise:</h2><p>Practicing boxing but not practicing kung fu<br>I figured out the principle, plan and everything, and finally reached the last step<br>Also the most simple step </p>
<p>Yes, you read it right, it’s the easiest step<br>As I said before, if Quanpin to Wubi is like learning English, then Quanpin to Shuangpin is as simple as learning Mandarin.<br>So students who have tried Wubi and gave up don’t have a psychological shadow. </p>
<p>It’s the easiest thing to say, because you only need to print out that key position, place it next to the computer, and open QQ, and chat with others every day as usual, and it’s OK. </p>
<h2 id="Self-practice"><a href="#Self-practice" class="headerlink" title="Self-practice"></a>Self-practice</h2><ul>
<li>Two days ago: It was weird (this time you will constantly want to switch back to ShuangPin, especially MM said that your typing is so slow, are you busy with other things, this point of pride is not necessary) </li>
<li>The next two days: Get used to it (the speed gradually increases, except for individual vowels that need to glance at the key table, and self-esteem slowly recovers)<br>One week later: Naturally, from now on, all people will be passers-by </li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations, one more skill necessary for home travel outfit B!<br>Especially when someone uses your computer to press out a series of inexplicable words </p>

<a id="more"></a>

<p>I have seen my colleague’s kindle5 before, it flashes when I turn the page<br>For me, who is accustomed to the refresh speed of mobile phones and other things, suddenly feel unacceptable<br>It’s been a few months since I bought this. The mini2 hasn’t been released yet, and the library here in Hefei is not strong </p>
<p>After really using it, I feel why it is called a reading artifact<br>First of all, electronic ink protects the eyes, is not as heavy as a mobile phone, and has a single function to reduce interference </p>
<p>And there used to be many problems with mobile phone reading<br>Unacceptable screen dead pixels, unsatisfactory format after PDF conversion, custom fonts, chatting online, playing games, etc. </p>
<p>One day I watched and suddenly discovered that I had subconsciously ignored the above issues, and focused entirely on the acquisition of content. </p>
<p>I can only sigh that this Dongdong experience is so awesome-I didn’t even realize it was uncomfortable, it’s really super value </p>

<li>Multi-platform synchronization </li>
<li>Reading time statistics </li>
</ul>
<p>When you get it, the kindle pw system has been upgraded to support pdf, and it may become bricked and repaired, so I don’t have to worry about it. </p>

    <title>Imperial City Tour</title>
    <url>/Travel-to-Beijing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of the imperial capital, this picture appeared in my mind: yellow sand is full of the sky, passers-by wearing thick masks; when it rains, the imperial capital can watch the sea and boat. </p>
<p>I don’t want to get out of the car and find that the sky is very weak, azure and blue. I can’t wait to type a few words on it to declare “I am sky blue”<br>After arriving at the hotel arranged by the tour guide, my little friend and I were shocked: they were rows of tiled houses and tiled houses. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="first-day"><a href="#first-day" class="headerlink" title="first day"></a>first day</h2><p>Earlier, I found plastic bags on the floor and dirty, messy, like the street scene behind the food stalls in Yingnan Town<br>Later, under the leadership of Director Ma, I felt that life in the imperial capital was so difficult<br>During this period, the horse guide has been on the road without stopping, as if he wanted to quickly end the day’s journey<br>It seems that Lingbo’s microstep has been small, and there is no big movement, but he slips away quickly, throwing us away.<br>Within half a day, we rushed to Tiananmen Square, National Museum, Military Museum, and then to the Water Cube/Bird’s Nest </p>
<p>KFC mentioned the small four at noon. I know that it is the small era who got an amazing 0.9 point on verycd. The lowest score seems to be 1 point. How did the 0.9 come about? Unconsciously<br>Then I was forced to watch an acrobatic performance<br>The results of the evening test were gratifying. After a year of hard work, I got a tan right away. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the tickets of a couple who are traveling together are the day after tomorrow, otherwise it is difficult to guarantee that they will go back the next day<br>Deeply experienced the struggle of the ant tribe of the Xiabei Piao family and the Chinese dream promoted everywhere </p>
<p>In the evening, I ate a big bowl house in a street that is known as gold everywhere. A friend who listened to the horse guide babbled how difficult it is to be in the imperial capital.<br>I was drinking water and thinking, damn it, it’s like you’re alone in the world<br>But after all, it’s a treat, and you have to pretend to be sympathetic. Fortunately, there is no laughter.<br>Not wanting to be the last, the couple wanted face and rushed to settle the account, and the tour guide happily took it back and reimbursed<br>When I came out, I imitated what Gandalf said to Bilbo Baggins in the movie The Hobbit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world is not in your maps and books ……When you come back, you will not be the same.<br>The world is not in your maps and notes… When you come back, you are different from others. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>PS1: The big bowl house that was eaten and closed in the first year of high school?<br>PS2: Wangfujing, at the same time @新华视点: At about 20:42 on the evening of the 30th, a man stabbed a girl with a knife in front of the gate of Xindongan Market in Wangfujing, Beijing </p>
<h2 id="the-next-day"><a href="#the-next-day" class="headerlink" title="the next day"></a>the next day</h2><p>I went to the Forbidden City and took a look. I don’t know why, every brick and every tile reveals a thick feudal ignorance<br>The tour guide is in Barabala, where there is no one else. Feng Shui and Yin-Yang are magical, but two passersby became free spectators </p>
<p>PS: One of them is still Huawei’s code farmer </p>
<p>In the meantime, I saw a long-haired foreign girl, with her head down, leaning on the railing quietly, with lovely freckles on her face. </p>
<p>PS: No wonder some white people tan their skin to wheat<br>PS: After seeing this kind of person, I feel that the world has calmed down. I have seen it several times in total. In this impetuous and noisy society, it gives people tranquility, and I don’t know when I can reach such a realm without using foreign objects. </p>
<p>In the evening, the horse guide changed to a five-star hotel, no, the Express Hotel outside the Fifth Ring Road<br>There was a disagreement over how to get the body to the destination<br>After doing a long subway journey, I found that some young people were reading mobile phones/books and were charging them every minute, including our horse guide. </p>
<p>This reminds me of the reading volume of the Russian nation, and the great dynasty is finally getting better<br>But will this continue to happen? Men and women tears </p>
<p>PS: I often don’t date girls and become notices </p>
<p>I have a mentality of inaction and don’t want to lie down with the gun, and the situation is getting worse<br>On the first day, I spit out the horse guide from time to time, but now I am too weak to spit out<br>People are hard to dismantle, omitted here </p>
<h2 id="Third-day"><a href="#Third-day" class="headerlink" title="Third day"></a>Third day</h2><p>I originally wanted to go to Peking University and other universities and Zhongguancun<br>But I heard that the new students are starting school recently, they may not be admitted<br>Coupled with the little thoughts of Tai Ji the other day </p>
<p>Look at the time and ride alone for thousands of miles.<br>Drinking a bottle of water from the Western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of the Chinese nation at the South Station, it was immediately full of positive energy<br>After reading a book in the car for a while, I got off and bought an ice cream<br>Super Plus enjoy </p>
<p>Of course the drawing Tucson is broken<br>Just then I received a text message and was asked to invite dinner<br>Dizzy, don’t you know if you’re tired?<br>I just came back from the imperial capital, so tired and half to death, I also invited to eat, let’s talk about my boyfriend,<br>Then the willpower that I watched in the past two days took effect, I remembered the green exercise, took a few deep breaths, asked why, and answered that I didn’t eat<br>I also think of being rejected by Ten Actions back then, and all kinds of cheating and dog-blood incidents afterwards. Looking back, it looks like a vulgar romance novel from the local to the scumbag.<br>I bought a watch last year and I made a mistake if I didn’t settle the account. </p>
<p>After I got home, I went online for more than an hour and found that there was no water<br>Suddenly, the revised Maslow needs levels are too accurate </p>
<p>When I ran to pay the water bill, the salesperson looked surprised and didn’t owe the bill.<br>In doubt, the landlord sent a text message saying that he closed the main gate </p>
<p>Damn it, your sister! ! ! I think they are still sitting on the red train </p>
<p>Later, I heard from the landlord’s wife that their carriage caught fire due to the aging line, and then they were called by the police to record the transcripts. It was that time. </p>
<p>So, you can’t speak too harshly, and you can’t be a man. Sao Nian </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Finally, I found this place because I wanted to have a blog of my own a few months ago </p>
<p>There are many public blogs, such as Douban and Sina, but none of them are my favorite </p>
<p>I just want to find a place where no one knows me, can record some of my <strong>experience</strong> or <strong>idea</strong> </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Qzone is a blog I have used for a long time, but the people in it are all my friends or colleagues. I don’t want to be regarded as a <strong>psychiatric</strong>. ^_^ </p>
<p>I followed the method of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb</a>, step by step, it seems to be successful, the page is online! There is a “<strong>Hexo</strong>“ on my website. </p>
<p>(Now, I use <strong>Hexo</strong> instead of jekyll) </p>
<p>In fact, as early as a year ago, I heard from a classmate that <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> can be used as a blog. But this task was delayed day by day. I think there must be a lot of configuration settings. Not only do I dislike <strong>complicated things</strong>, but as a <strong>procrastinator</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.englishiskillingme.com/">English is driving me crazy</a>, I don’t have enough ability to do this </p>

    <title>The murder caused by two bottles of Jiaduobao</title>
    <url>/Two-bottles-of-blood-caused-by-Jiaduobao/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Two small partners, a good relationship<br>One of them is from the police school and the other is from Chinese medicine </p>
<p>A friend of Chinese medicine doctor came over as a guest, and quarreled when he left, and was fined 5 yuan to buy a bottle of Jiaduobao that he had just drunk.<br>Because it is nearly 43% higher than the market price, it may have caused a psychological imbalance in the Chinese medicine partner. He actually took the risk and tried to take another bottle of Jiaduobao.<br>After being discovered, the nature of the natural incident escalated, and the friends of the police academy felt mentally insulted<br>And the TCM friends stubbornly resisted, and at the same time unconsciously brought on taunting skills<br>In the end, he tried to settle the incident with RMB and was punched afterwards. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I thought that the little friend who studied Chinese medicine was like me. He had never used hands since he was a child, and he has not even seen people do hands. He has little on-the-spot experience, so he has been in a passive state of being beaten. dps<br>Later I found out that my drawing Tucson was broken </p>
<p>When I reacted and thought about pulling, the battle was over<br>The incident was so sudden, I didn’t react at all, and my fellow Chinese medicine practitioner was hit<br>The final blow is a flying kick + back head knife<br>After the incident, I somehow appeared in the arcade 2x combo<br>Probably I didn’t expect that my fellow police academy would really do it. I was shocked! </p>
<p>After that, the police academy’s friend blocked the door and refused to let the Chinese medicine partner go. I didn’t understand at the time, but now I remember<br>It often appears in martial arts novels that after receiving a palm, there was no problem at the time, and after a few steps out of the gate, he vomited blood and fell to the ground.<br>Of course, after a consensus, the TCM friends still left </p>
<p>Don’t worry, ask him about his injuries, whether he suffered internal injuries when he was kicked, and whether he had bruises on his stomach.<br>I don’t want to be unscathed and have been active on the dating scene with his GL </p>
<p>-_-||| </p>
<p>The little friend from the police academy here said that the soft tissue of the hand seemed to be injured, and it hurts when he moved. </p>
<p>-_-||| </p>
<p>I asked my friends who have traditional Chinese medicine before that if they don’t practice internal strength, they know how to acupuncture and moxibustion.<br>The result was still vowed </p>
<p>Given his GL surname Zhang, could it be that the following episode happened at that moment: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this moment of silence, the little friend of Chinese medicine suddenly remembered a few words in the textbook: “He is strong by him, and the breeze blows the mountains. He is horizontal, and the moon shines on the river.” He was there. When I read these few texts in the study room, I still didn’t understand the reason. At this moment, I suddenly remembered that with the tyranny and viciousness of the police school students, oneself is by no means an enemy. According to the main point of the textbook, it seems that no matter how strong the enemy is, No matter how ferocious, he can be regarded as the breeze blowing on the mountain and the bright moon reflecting on the river. Although it can be applied to me, it cannot be damaged in the slightest. But how can I not harm my body? The text below said: “He is cruel and hates himself, I am really angry.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>T M D is this playing me </p>
<p>Given that these two terrorists often move within five feet of our radius<br>I decided to complete Chum kiu as much as possible this weekend, just in case </p>

<p>radiant defense, Chinese called dazzle defense<br>As the name suggests, the picture is very beautiful, I like it right away<br>But don’t want to be the hardest game </p>

<p>In terms of diplomacy, he stretched out his hands and didn’t hit the smiley people, stuffed money everywhere, watched the frictions in the surrounding countries, played happily, and developed quietly. </p>
<p>I remember when I was in junior high school, I asked my teacher about the Blitz, why some European countries surrendered without fighting.<br>The teacher smiled, hundreds of tanks pressed over, how to fight<br>At that time, all I knew was that when the empire moves, one hundred regiments will fight. I don’t know the hardships of foreign wars on population<br>And the philosophy at the time was that a soldier can be killed and not be insulted. It is better to fight until there is only one brick and one tile left than to let the enemy even half a step<br>What’s more, people just drove to the national border and didn’t fire a shot. Why did they kneel and lick it? (There was no such saying at that time)<br>At that time, I still couldn’t understand or even know the state of the soldiers who came to the city without fighting. </p>
<p>When I was in full diplomacy and distributed the submarines, and then almost at the same time, one nuclear bomb was in a warehouse, and I passed the declaration of war and directly exploded the opponent out, it seemed to understand a little bit. </p>

    <title>Why Hexo</title>
    <url>/why-hexo/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I used Jekyll when I first built it, Octopress never tried it<br>Jekyll’s framework design is divided into two parts: code + generated webpage<br>When uploading to github, the code part is pushed up, and hexo is a locally generated webpage, which should have certain advantages in speed<br>I saw that the default template is also pretty, so I changed to hexo yesterday </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I feel that the biggest feature of hexo is that it hides cumbersome commands<br>In Jekyll’s words, at least a dozen items from construction to completion<br>And writing a new article requires at least </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jekyll new post xxx</span><br><span class="line">vim _post/<span class="variable">$time</span>-xxx</span><br><span class="line">git commit -a -m xxx</span><br><span class="line">git push remote master</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Maybe in the eyes of many people, it’s already very simple </p>
<p>But know that some people ** are not siege lions<strong>, they just want to start a blog without thinking, and the focus is on **writing</strong><br>And before writing, you have to make so many commands by Parapara, if you forget one, or miss a parameter, you have to -h, if your English is not good, you have to google, be walled, you have to baidu, wait until the real When writing, I don’t know how many Pomodoros are.<br>And jekyll has at least a bit of git concept, if you write a Chinese blog, you have to change ruby (utf-8)<br>Every day, every day, every day! </p>
<p>And hexo is really simple, you only need to know 8 letters in the whole process </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo n <span class="comment"># new</span></span><br><span class="line">hexo g <span class="comment"># generate</span></span><br><span class="line">hexo s <span class="comment"># server</span></span><br><span class="line">hexo d <span class="comment"># deploy</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>For me and other non-professional siege lions, it’s so refreshing to use it to tears. </p>

<ul>
<li>must </li>
<li>Comfortable.do </li>
<li>wunderlist </li>
</ul>
<p>These three are all good tools that support multi-platform synchronization (mac ios win android)<br>Each has its own characteristics, regardless of the ranking, you can try it out by yourself and choose the one you like </p>
<p>But after using it, you will find that the plan is still not completed. It was originally in the “Today” project, but it is still “Today” a week later.<br>Just like we all know about procrastination, and anger changes it, but it is often delayed until the last moment; don’t senior smokers know that smoking is harmful to your health, or that one after a meal can beat a living god<br>Therefore, if you don’t discover from yourself, even with the best software, you can’t stop the dissipation of time. </p>

<h2 id="How-to-prevent-“invalid-time”"><a href="#How-to-prevent-“invalid-time”" class="headerlink" title="How to prevent “invalid time”"></a>How to prevent “invalid time”</h2><p>First of all, it is stated that time is equivalent and there is no such thing as “invalid”. I just want to express that the past day was different from what you expected to do, and you don’t know “how did another day pass”) </p>
<p>“A Strange Life” describes a person who is accompanied by time—Liubischev, and introduces his method of time statistics. It is said that this person has an inherent time observation<br>In this TED video, Philip Sinbad introduced <a href="http://v.163.com/movie/2011/9/I/L/M7CEB9FAL_M7CEBDOIL.html">Healthy Time Concept 
</a>, I think it should be the same kind of things </p>
<p>Ljubischev’s feeling of time passing, accurate to the minute, I think it’s not difficult. (For example, I used to use a regular screen every day, how many years, I didn’t feel anything, I’ve seen Retina and come back again. It’s no good, maybe I noticed those <strong>details</strong>) accurate to ten minutes, half an hour, it’s always possible </p>
<p>So, you should spend a month, at least a week, and don’t plan anything first. Use half an hour as a unit to truthfully <strong>write down where your time is spent</strong>, accumulate raw data, and take a look at yourself. How did you spend the day </p>
<p>You may find that you have checked Weibo, surfed the Internet, etc. With these data, you will be aware of this next time you do this kind of thing. </p>

At first, it seemed to mark the interview time of various companies. Later, I slowly started to record other things. Then I saw “A Strange Life”, which actually fits the habits of the great god Happy<br>…<br>(I’m so exhausted, I’ll write later) </p>
<p>Although I kept recording since then, I didn’t really summarize it until I saw this book a few days ago. </p>
<p>I haven’t read it yet, but I have gained a lot. The notes are [here](<a href="http://leihao0.github.io/2013/12/16/%E6%8A%8A%E6%97%B6%E9%97%">http://leihao0.github.io/2013/12/16/%E6%8A%8A%E6%97%B6%E9%97%</a> B4%E7%95%99%E7%BB%99%E6%9C%80%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B/)<br>(This author seems to be a master, covering all aspects, from how to find your own interests to how to realize your dreams, and so on. I don’t want to read this answer, but it’s best to read the book, <em>*strongly recommended</em> *) </p>
<p>Colors are added to the calendar in the book: </p>
<ul>
<li>Black: career and achievement </li>
<li>Red: Family and social communication </li>
<li>Yellow: healthy </li>
<li>Blue: the meaning and value of life </li>
</ul>
<p>At that time, my eyes lit up, and I felt a kind of enlightenment. I immediately went to Google Calendar and tried to mark a few weeks.<br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1fLFHiN0styGRBRNyOok0ySL0EbBIyCnXxZcfCW6UGL1Lmx6noMFn0ak7pvfGVKigDYUfyWHDcs=s640-h400-e365" alt=""><br>Sure enough, after that, every night, every weekend, as long as you glance at it, you will know the general consumption of time in all aspects.<br>But before I didn’t watch each Event one by one, I couldn’t figure out what I did. </p>
<p>I think many people are reluctant to summarize and organize their desktops. It may be because there are too many tedious things and their brains are messed up. They feel that it takes too long to organize, and they don’t have a good framework. Then drag it. This is probably the reason for keen to pursue software (tools) </p>
<p>Followed by Google Task<br>This thing seems to be a list, and it can be graded<br>I used to record some recent things to do, and when adding Event, it is convenient to copy and paste (Is this Google’s original intention? 囧) </p>

<li>Health </li>
<li>Economic independence </li>
<li>Ideal </li>
</ol>
<p>I have been using Google Calendar for almost two years, and I can’t remember how it started. It implies “A Strange Life”, but it’s just a record.<br>Colors were added to this book, which made my eyes shine. I immediately went to google and tried to mark it for a few weeks. </p>
<ul>
<li>Black: career and achievement </li>
<li>Red: Family and social communication </li>
<li>Yellow: healthy </li>
<li>Blue: the meaning and value of life </li>
</ul>
<p>The calendar that was originally all-colored is immediately colorful and comes alive </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/calendar.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As stated in the book: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brush of life is always in your own hands. More black, blue or red is entirely up to your personal decision. I believe that as long as you complete this painting according to your own inner requirements, it must be the most beautiful in your heart. masterpiece. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, it turned out to be everyone’s method of “How to Find Your Dream” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are subtle changes in society all the time. Over-developed information transmission means that the boundary between true and false is becoming more and more blurred. People’s psychological anxiety is increasing day by day, and their self-awareness is becoming stronger and stronger. The focus on others has shifted to self-introspection, and the pursuit of consciousness and morality has changed more urgently than in any previous historical period. </p>
<p>When a person doubts the meaning and value of his life, he is sick. </p>

<p>This thing is like kung fu. At the master level, flying flowers and picking leaves can hurt people.<br>For example, one of my classmates used 3M sticky notes as Note (Later I saw “Too Stupid Book of Heaven” said that no more than three at a time, complete one, and tear one off from the display)<br>Of course, having a NB software when we are not so NB is just like a tiger.<br>The most important thing is not to forget the original purpose of GTD and form your own management system </p>

<p>No wonder Ruby gives you freedom. From the perspective of syntactic sugar alone, it is better than Python<br>I didn’t like Ruby because of the’end’ problem, but I did it as a whole: </p>
<ol>
<li>There is no need to pay attention to indentation everywhere like Python, and it can be indented automatically (Python has never seen it before), so worry-free </li>
<li>: Etc. symbols are reduced, function calls are more natural </li>
<li>More object-oriented (Python still has the concept of type (int str…), passing parameters, return values, etc. are particularly obvious; Ruby is weakened, and you can’t even feel the existence of types when you use it) </li>
</ol>
<p>As a whole, it is realized </p>
<ol>
<li>Algorithm has nothing to do with code, much less than Python </li>
<li>It’s more natural to write </li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, it is best not to make subjective judgments before you understand something </p>
<p>PS:<br>Java and Android have been used for nearly a year, but there is no love. I don’t understand this. </p>
<hr>
<p>2014-01-03 23:37:58<br>Do not use Python and Ruby at the same time </p>
<p>Since Ruby is in front, end is fine </p>
<p>I was sad when I wrote Python, I always forgot the <strong>colon</strong>, and it is easy to forget <strong>return</strong><br>class wants (object), def func(self): torture people everywhere </p>
<p>++ &amp;&amp; This way of writing from C is also a face </p>
<p>The functions of these two languages are different. For example: </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">python.append()  ruby.add()</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">len(python) ruby.len</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It is often mixed, and the error is only found after submission, plus the internet speed… </p>
<hr>
<p>It hurts to use a proxy card, you can’t get in without even entering… </p>
<p>I’m still the kind of person who writes two sentences and runs them to see the results<br>A lot of time is wasted waiting for the results after submission<br>It is said that Ruby is slow, the most exaggerated one is that after ROR is converted to GO, the server dropped from 30 to 2<br>I still don’t believe it, but it’s just a problem (of course it should be the internet speed or the web server)<br>But this is a rush to tell people that Ruby is slow with someone else’s life… speechless </p>
<p>Stupid reminder<br>Mainland too card, after a long time, it prompts to check the loop, please ask me a for/while, is it OK?<br>Especially Ruby, a language that has N methods </p>
<p>There are two judgment conditions for the feeling result: </p>
<ol>
<li>Result string comparison </li>
<li>Source code regular inspection </li>
</ol>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>It’s not cold, but it’s quite speechless </p>
<p>Choose a job after graduation, let me go to graduate school<br>When I was just working, I asked me to take a civil service exam every time I called (what if those who say they want to make a phone call from time to time and keep in touch?)<br>Gap Year (I didn’t ask my parents for a penny), and still despise me every day </p>
<p>In short, I feel that you are their private property. LZ brought you into the world, not what I said?<br>by! When it grows up, its wings become hard and it becomes disobedient, right? </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Then began to point fingers at you in an attempt to tamper with your life: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use power and brainwash (since I was young, now I just need to turn on the switch)<br>Move out the unwarranted “The king wants the minister to die, the minister has to die. The father wants the son to die, the son has to die.”<br>Taken out of context “Parents are here, so don’t travel far away”<br>Filial piety first<br>… </li>
</ol>
<p>PS: Did they watch “1984”? My knowledge is superficial. . . </p>
<p>But you may have been bathed in Western equality thoughts and read<br>Rousseau’s “On the Origin of Human Inequality”, Russell’s “History of Western Philosophy”, Thoreau’s “Walden” and other masterpieces<br>Towards independence of mind, not the same as Confucianism </p>
<p>It’s ok: </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use material means to kidnap you<br>Common: full payment, down payment, job arrangement, etc. </li>
</ol>
<p>According to “Influence”, give the other party a little benefit, don’t feel that the other party owes you, so that they can get more benefits<br>That is, “Eat people’s mouth and soften their hands” </p>
<p>But you may have read Krishnamurti’s “The Things You Must Not Think of in Life”, Lao Tzu’s “Tao Te Ching”, and “The Power of the Present” when you were weak.<br>Understand that life should liberate oneself and seek inner tranquility most<br>And the strength is relatively strong, LZ can be self-reliant, these things are not required, they still live well. </p>
<p>Brother is financially independent, so you can’t do anything to me. </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter, what else is there: </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sorry<br>Even if you are in a mess, but<br>People are not plants, who can be ruthless, after all, blood is thicker than water<br>They tried to kidnap you with family<br>“I live for you in this life”, “Don’t blame your parents, they have given you the best” </li>
</ol>
<p>I go, do you think the “best” is what I want? </p>
<p>“We have done this for you, are you worthy of me?”<br>Ο \ _ \ _ Ο “…<br>Where did this sour rushing come from? (“The Road Few People Walk” mentioned this kind of parents with deep sacrificial spirit, embarrassing) </p>
<p>“We are your parents, of course we must care about you”<br>Please, this is obviously trying to control others, no one cares<br>What kind of tone is used to care about a person? ? ? </p>
<p>PS: There is also this problem between lovers </p>
<hr>
<p>The words above are a bit serious<br>In fact, in the generation of parents (they were also young, okay), most of them became victims of the lack of education.<br>Black-and-white thinking, people speak differently, without the ability to think independently </p>
<p>Cause them to fail to realize the improprieties of their thinking, thoughts, attitude, and tone<br>I don’t look at the facts, but I think I’m right. After all, I eat more salt than a child’s food. I have a posture of “what I say is the truth of the universe”. Reasoning is useless. </p>
<p>As children, knowing that it’s not their reason, it’s very sad to see them in that tone<br>The best way (I can think of now) may be to cater and do some “white lies” to coax them happy<br>But when it comes to major events, paper cannot contain the fire, and conflict is still inevitable </p>
<p>Due to age, it is almost impossible for the elderly to come into contact with new ideas. It is no longer realistic to ask the previous generation to change<br>But we can start with the next generation-I wonder if you realize that our generation is going to be mom and dad too </p>
<p>So we can ask questions such as: “How to communicate with parents”, “How to keep parents from getting angry”, “Is there any way to make myself think that the advice of parents is correct”, “How to be an obedient child”, “I want to test How to persuade civil servants/researchers/doctors/post-doctors to stay in their hometowns and their parents refuse </p>
<p>Then remind them of Shangzhihu </p>

<p>The school where the little mage is located is ranked thousands of miles away in the magic world. Looking around, there is no magical master in the whole school. </p>
<p>When the little mage graduates, it will only be a static magic </p>
<p>Although this kind of magic is very NB, but it takes too long, and you have to stand still when casting the spell </p>
<p>Until a few days ago, the little mage suddenly heard that there is a magic that can be sung while walking, and he became very curious. </p>
<p>After reading the latest magic book, I found that among all the dynamic magic, there is a magic called Ruby on Orbit </p>
<p>This kind of magic pronunciation is weird and inexplicable, but as long as the singing is right, you can summon the most lethal magic in the shortest time. </p>
<p>Then he was killed by the magic he summoned </p>

<p>The little mage’s elves were so-so, guessing, half of the practice, a little uncomfortable reaction </p>
<p>In Chapter 9, the continuous casting time was too long, and the magic showed signs of backlash. </p>
<p>Prior to this, the courses of the Little Mage at Codecademy Academy were smoothly removed. The hypertext markup spell, hierarchical style sheet, python ruby are all available, and there are only 3 chapters left in the book. </p>
<p>It just so happened that Little Master was poured a lot of chicken soup from Moments, such as: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person, if you don’t force yourself, you don’t know how good you are; a person, if you don’t force yourself, your world will always be black </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and also: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a person wants to be excellent, you must accept the challenge; a person, if you want to be excellent as soon as possible, you must find a challenge </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is conceivable that the little mage is full of confidence and full of positive energy </p>
<p>Ignoring that the mage does not have a strong body like a swordsman, and has professional limitations, most of them are in sub-health </p>
<p>Coupled with lack of mana, I have to play technology </p>
<p>Finally in the final chapter, the red and blue were exhausted, and he was beaten to death by the monster he summoned. </p>
<hr>
<p>Fortunately, the little mage has a lower level and a shorter resurrection time </p>
<p>But wasted a rebirth ankh for no reason, the little mage is still very unhappy </p>
<p>When people around me kindly ask, they can only knock down their teeth and swallow blood. </p>
<p>After all, as a mage, it’s shameful to be killed by a spell he summoned. </p>
<p>After this incident, the little mage was also forced to form a Pavlovian restriction, that is, the animal’s response to specific stimuli </p>
<p>Now I feel nauseous when I see Elvish </p>
<p>So the little mage decided to never touch magic anymore recently </p>
<p>… </p>

<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>To say something irrelevant: </p>
<p>I still remember when I was in elementary school, I asked to write essays every day. At that time, I was really abused.<br>I write (chao) homework every day when I go to school and after school. I still have one piece a day. I can only record something for a week at most.<br>What should I do, I can only copy the sample text </p>
<p>It’s a pity that there was no theoretical guidance at that time, and the copying was not accurate. After the primary school students’ model essays were copied, there was no way to copy them, so I reluctantly started the idea of a Chinese textbook.<br>Tai Sui broke ground on his head, didn’t he die early, but he was naturally found out </p>
<p>Then the third-grade Chinese teacher, known as the engineer of the human soul, slapped my head severely in front of the class with my diary. </p>
<p>Oh (wocao), you don’t have to be so cruel to kill the chicken and the monkey. </p>
<p>At that time, I couldn’t bear it, and silently improved my skills. After all, the college entrance examination still has eight-part essays. For the sake of tomorrow, if I can’t bear it, I will make a big plan. (Well, I was stupid at the time. Nian still thinks that father beats his son like that) </p>
<p>Fortunately, college, finally no need to write those disgusting things<br>When I was a freshman, a roommate despised my bad space, and then went to dress up, hang up more than N Flash, the card can not be opened<br>Later, I found out that there was a log function, and I wrote something about the school casually, and then some students commented, I was very happy, and then I wrote<br>It took me more than a year to learn that this thing is called a blog </p>
<p>Later, the programming stuff was hung up on CSDN, looking at the thousand miles away in the lower left corner, silently left </p>
<p>I searched for things when I was about to graduate. I saw what Yiya wrote and I was familiar with it. I saw that the number of visits was more than 1W, and there was still a ranking. I wondered who this is. I took a closer look. </p>
<p>Later, I wanted to find a place that no one knew, and record something </p>

    <title>Free will</title>
    <url>/Free-Will/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know when I heard the word “free will”, and it feels like more than a year </p>
<p>Although I sometimes use this term, I never understand what <strong>free will</strong> is </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>In fact, Google can get the answer right away, but I didn’t do it for a long time. Do I want to understand it based on my own insight? </p>
<p>I first heard this word in Dongwu’s Theory of Relativity<br>I can come across in some of the next books<br>Later on Luo Ji Siwei heard<br>In the previous BBC Hawking universe, “We are all made of interstellar matter” </p>
<p>It feels like people respond rationally rather than instinctively to external stimuli </p>
<p>Three quotes from the author’s epiphany quoted in “Seven Habits”: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a space between stimulus and response<br>In this space we have the freedom and ability to choose our own response<br>Our growth and happiness depend on our response </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t feel anything when I watched it, and I am <strong>simply knowledgeable</strong> %&gt;_&lt;% </p>
<p>Then I saw the author’s explanation, <strong>Freedom of Choice</strong>, I couldn’t help but breathe a breath of air (in winter)-I realized it for the sake of my enlightenment.<br>Isn’t this free will? ! </p>
<p>I have never understood before, what is the difference between tossing around when I was young, and then falling into the hot bed of my wife and child, and directly falling into it. It feels there, but I can’t tell the difference. </p>
<p>From this point of view, it should be the difference between free will awakening, respecting one’s inner call, and not simply making a stressful like ordinary creatures. </p>
<p>Listen to thunder in the silent place </p>

    <title>goddess</title>
    <url>/Goddess/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned earlier, the little mage is never going to watch magic anymore </p>
<p>Zhu Xi said: “It’s enough to stop, there is no greed.”<br>The little mage’s mental plan is good, can’t fight to hide </p>
<p>Life is often so funny or cruel<br>The Tao Te Ching says: “The way of the sky will damage more and make up for the insufficiency, but the way of man is not, the way of man will damage the insufficiency and give more.”<br>As the saying goes, “I will kill you when you are sick” </p>
<p>After being humiliated by magic, Murphy’s Law began to show its power-the goddess of the little mage ignored him </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>The thing is like this: </p>
<p>A few days ago, the goddess suddenly called the little mage, unknowingly, the two chatted for more than an hour<br>On the phone, the goddess complained to the little mage that she was tired recently, and then she pointed out that she wanted a magic book container, which is the latest powerful magical tool called the bright pure sticker produced by the evil magic group. The goddess used some news in the magic world to deal with the aftermath, which is really accurate </p>
<p>The little mage was flattered when he received the call, and in the next few days he was even more excited, seeing the goddess’ birthday is coming again, so let’s give it away. </p>
<p>Gold coins are a problem, but fortunately, the little mage usually saves money, eats frugally, and barely manages enough.<br>After comparing prices for a long time, I finally bought one for the goddess in my heart </p>
<p>Two days after the goods arrived, I saw the goddess replied “I like it, thank you”<br>Before the little mage could respond, he saw the goddess offline </p>
<p>The little mage has no doubts about the others, and he is infinitely happy, just like the little yellow guy in “Despicable Me 2” saw the heroine develop rich associations and imaginations </p>
<p>But a day later the goddess still did not respond<br>At the beginning, the little mage simply thought that she was a goddess, she must be very busy, but it is normal that she doesn’t reply to messages on the forum and chatting on Weibo every day. </p>
<p>By the evening of the next day, Little Mage felt something was wrong. QQ, WeChat, Weibo, SMS, phone, and various contact magic were all used. </p>
<p>The goddess is worthy of being a goddess, and uses the art of war flexibly to cope with all changes in the same way, gently and ingeniously:<br><code>&gt;/dev/null</code> </p>
<p>Just wiped out all the magic that the little mage could think of, leaving no ripples </p>
<p>Apart from sang heart, little mage still has a glimmer of hope in his heart </p>
<p>Then I saw this cruel question: </p>
<p>*<em>How to raise a spare tire? *</em><br>answer:<br>If the spare tyre takes the initiative to talk to you, you just haha<br>The spare tire is no longer active, just ask him what he is doing </p>
<p>The little mage recalled everything before, as if he was verifying these two sentences<br>Really <em>words are like blood, actions are like complaints, grief and arousal</em> </p>
<p>The little mage’s eyes were hot, and finally she shed tears </p>

    <title>Spare tire</title>
    <url>/Spare-Tyre/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The goddess’s blow to the little mage far exceeded the little mage’s imagination<br>In this way, the last death was like a floating cloud </p>
<p>The poet Yuan Hao of the Jin Dynasty asked Youyun: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask what love in the world is, and teach life and death directly?<br>——“Moyuer·Yanqiu Ci” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little mage is an emotional child. When he was still in the mage academy, he liked a girl and pursued it hard for 3 years. When he bought a gift for the girl’s birthday and waited downstairs, he found that the girl and a frustrated man were flying together. </p>
<p>Everyone has moments of disillusionment, and the three years of misery finally brought the little wizard’s epiphany<br>Since then, fascinated by magic and eventually become a master </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Of course that happened in the novel<br>At that time, campus recruitment was already in place, and the young master rushed into battle, but ended up in an embarrassing result </p>
<p>Originally, the little mage thought that after he was enlightened, he was already invulnerable and rational, and would no longer be confused about emotional matters. </p>
<p>But he forgot the famous saying of the ancient philosopher Heraclitus: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One cannot step into the same river twice </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course the little mage didn’t violate it, it just fell into a different ditch. </p>
<p>The money is gone and come back, and the loss of money is a trivial matter. The biggest pitfall is, “You treat the other party as a goddess, and the other party treats you as a fool.” </p>
<p>With previous experience, the little mage woke up faster this time, but heartache is inevitable </p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are several feasible options for dealing with broken relationships: </p>
<ol>
<li>Retaliation </li>
<li>Divert attention </li>
<li>Sublimation </li>
</ol>
<p>The first cost is too high, it is a lose-lose<br>The last one is the optimal solution, but the realm is too high, the little mage can’t reach </p>
<p>Had to take the golden mean route: divert attention </p>
<p>After that, the little mage tries to keep himself busy </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>The situation has not improved yet, the annual Spring Festival in the mainland has come again<br>At this time of year, the Scrolls of Return to Town are sold out early </p>
<p>The little mage had to use time-consuming and laborious teleportation </p>
<p>Before entering the house, I saw the blood-red door pair on both sides of the door from a distance: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Year after year, we get married year after year without us </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horizontal batch: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait another year </p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Mom and dad</title>
    <url>/Mon-and-Dad/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The little mage’s parents are all Muggles, and there are no magicians in the surrounding circle. At one time they thought that the little mage assembled and repaired magical instruments after graduation. </p>
<p>The little mage was born in the environment of Jiangzi, ╮(￣ ▽ ￣”)╭, it is so terrible that it is indescribable, but it can be seen how difficult it is to communicate with parents </p>
<p>This time the annual family reunion day, the little mage returned very unwillingly </p>
<p>why? This involves two points: </p>
<ol>
<li>Chinese parents </li>
<li>The little mage did not look for a job after resigning </li>
</ol>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Muggle moms and dads have a deep sense of self-sacrifice<br>Even in the economic environment where they are now fully prosperous, they can still magically divide the dishes on the table into three or six or nine grades, giving them the meaty stuff, organic vegetables and high-fiber foods for themselves<br>“We have done this for you, are you worthy of us like this?” is a common killer. </p>
<p>For this, the little mage can’t use “Silly boy paper, you can still go to die!” A similar forbidden curse is broken, otherwise it will only be yourself who will hang up, and will not be able to live well after death, and be hanged on innocence. The charge of unrighteousness and unfilial piety is a negative example of the rumors of Muggle-style parents </p>
<p>The little mage has explained to his parents countless times that he belongs to the late gap year for things that are not working. It is a confusion in life, and it takes a period of silence… (If you have the opportunity to say it separately in the future)<br>But moms and dads don’t care about this kind of rhetoric. If you don’t have a job, isn’t it a youth in society? If you make moms and dads unable to lift their heads in front of relatives and friends, don’t use a whip to get you to find a job. </p>
<p>The little mage firmly believes that financial independence can be exchanged for freedom, so he no longer asks parents for living expenses<br>This creates a strange phenomenon. On the one hand, the little mage has no job, and on the other hand, the living standard of the little mage is only slightly reduced.<br>Mom and Dad who are Muggles didn’t understand it at all, so they became detectives and started their own reasoning: Where did the living expenses come from? rMBP How can such precious artifacts be exchanged for gold coins? It’s hard to steal it? Why are you different from ordinary people? Are you mentally ill? Should see a psychologist… </p>
<p>The little mage is sad, hates blood thicker than water, cuts on the constant family affection, and the annual holiday. The most exaggerated thing is that ZF also intervened in this matter. The legislation did not see his parents convicted, and he was imprisoned after enforcement… </p>
<p>The little mage doesn’t have the guts to fight against the public power. As a P citizen, it’s better to be self-conscious<br>However, before returning home this Spring Festival, the little mage had already been familiar with the art of war and had made sufficient preparations. He imagined that he possessed the forbidden curse of a senior in the magical world who had already traveled to the west of Hexi-Reality Distortion Force Field (PS: Suddenly thought of science Personal reality in the super-electromagnetic gun) </p>

Some wizards have discovered the commonalities and refined them. Only sending TIASF can complete the chanting of magic. born </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>After the triple blow, the little mage has been living in the shadows </p>
<p>Looking at the magisters in the world of wizards, all kinds of magic are often readily available.<br>A master of carbon magic, the coffee produced in Java is also decent to use, no need to start from scratch. </p>
<p>The little mage thought that in this case, coupled with the evil “reasonable adjustment of emotions”-to keep yourself busy, it is better to settle down. </p>
<p>After that, I started reading non-stop, Xanaduola, gunpowder and other frame magic </p>
<p>(PS: The section of the plant. Polymer cement is also within the scope of training, but unfortunately I did not find the spell book “The section of the plant. Polymer cement”, plus the little mage not long ago bought a magic tool (also Not for myself), I was ashamed in my pocket, so I had to give up) </p>
<p>The little mage has read “Tao-Te Ching”, and there is a saying that the soldier will win<br>Roughly speaking, the opposing armies, the side full of grief and anger, will surely win </p>
<p>The little mage’s gritted teeth at this moment can be described as grief and anger </p>
<p>There is a book on the mainland that is thicker than a few slabs stacked together. It is divided into nine books and records those things in the mainland 600 years ago.<br>After reading it, the most impressive thing is not any tricks, but whenever there is a bad guy or conspiracy and timing, the sentence is often inserted suddenly: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to IQ limitation </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The failures of the predecessors, the lessons for future generations<br>The poor little mage only reads magic books every day, so he doesn’t know anything about history. </p>
<p>And because of the complexity of watching more at once, gradually, the little mage found that when singing python magic, he often blended the spell of ruby into it, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Finally, the little mage was surprised to find that he couldn’t even release a decent magic. </p>

<p>Relatively speaking, the coverage is relatively comprehensive, and the examples are also very representative. Buying is worth the price </p>
<p>Not to mention that the author puts the book on the Internet, you can find it by searching it </p>
<p>Learning By Doing, I wrote a website to try the water: </p>

<hr>
<p>From Python to Ruby to Node.js to Golang </p>
<p>Ruby is really amazing. Let’s not talk about the degree of freedom. In terms of syntactic sugar, it is the language that I feel is the closest to pseudo-code. (Human attention to indentation) </p>
<p>Node.js, because I don’t know JavaScript, I don’t know much about this </p>
<p>Then I saw Go. Since my entry language is C, this one has a natural intimacy and familiarity. </p>
<p>However, when switching from Ruby to Go, the most uncomfortable part is that you have to declare the variable type again. The more complex data needs to be converted by the interface. </p>
<p>Slowly I learned that this is to check out the BUG before compiling. Dynamic languages can only be tested by human flesh. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The little mage hadn’t moved for a while, why did it pop up again? Because this time is special </p>
<p>In the afternoon, the little mage was basking in the sun on the balcony, looking at the mob recommended by the goddess two days ago, and when he was bored, he swiped Q, and when he saw the goddess was online, he went to chat. </p>
<p>I didn’t expect the goddess to answer every sentence, and the response was very fast </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>It is said that the little mage should be very happy, but he instinctively feels a kind of coolness-too abnormal<br>Careful temptation: </p>
<p>A raise?<br>No<br>Promoted? </p>
<p>In love? When the little mage has been hit and hasn’t sent it out<br>The goddess automatically told the little mage the good news<br>Little mage, his eyes went dark, almost fainted </p>
<p>Reality is always cruel and often dramatic<br>Seeing that the gap is about to end, the little mage slapped him severely when he was already drawing a picture of the future.<br>And history is always surprisingly similar. At this time last year, the little wizard had already suffered a blow no less than the disaster of extinction. </p>
<p>According to the principle (I forgot, roughly the emotions come from the reptilian brain and do not pass through the human neocortex, so in non-life-threatening situations, the momentary feeling is often a harmful judgment), the little mage takes a deep breath for 10 seconds ,then… </p>
<p>Enduring the bloody heart, made a phone call and chatted for a while, but at the end I haven’t forgotten to wish them happiness<br>What I really think in my mind, without mentioning a word </p>
<p>After hanging up, looking at the carefully prepared gift, the little mage was full of sadness<br>Is this the rhythm that is destined for a lonely life? </p>

    <title>Complications of broken love</title>
    <url>/Complications-of-Lovelorn/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, after the protagonist of a series has died, it is often the end </p>
<p>For example, in “Ice and Snow Fantasy”, at the end of the story, the elder sister wins love, two mushrooms cool the lace, and the male pig’s feet have to be with the animal (the end of life is often sad) </p>
<p>However, given that this is a novel and there are precedents before it, “Rework” also mentioned that “modifying a BUG often introduces a new BUG”<br>In desperation, we acquiesce that the little mage can be resurrected </p>
<p>But the little mage suffered so much that he broke through the level of resurrection time, staying in the altar and reluctant to come out, so he had to get a special first. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>When we read some books about history, we often notice a word: historical limitations </p>
<p>For independent individuals, it also exists<br>For example, half a year or a year later, as long as you continue to move forward mentally and look back suddenly, you can often find your own limitations, such as things that you have come up with now, but were in a hurry at the time. </p>
<p>As someone who came over, often </p>
<p>persuade: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>No reality<br>If the goddess is gone, find another one<br>The setback I have experienced is much greater than you, and I haven’t survived it. You are completely too weak to withstand stress. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the parties involved, let’s not talk about beating them in the past. After all, they are kind, but they can’t relieve much pain in my heart. </p>
<p>In fact, when we ourselves are parties, we often cannot escape this vicious circle. </p>
<p>Human beings have the function of forgetting pain, the most obvious is as a top painful childbirth. After one or two years of numbness, the idea of regenerating a child will be born. </p>
<p>So when the time is long enough, the original pain will be forgotten, and it is not a big deal to lose love. </p>
<p>At this time, there must be broken-up children’s shoes around, and we will have the same feeling-isn’t it just broken-up, what’s the big deal, often goto’persuade’` </p>
<hr>
<p>When writing stuff, you should pay attention to the ups and downs. Authors with deep internal skills will internalize this into the atmosphere of the plot, without a trace, and the low-level will often see a dry transitional tone: </p>
<p><strong>but</strong> </p>
<p>Most of the time, we don’t know why we are suffering, so we can only use the phenomenon of “broken love” to summarize </p>
<p>So everyone is broken in love, why someone can immediately turn to chase another girl (beast!!! Okay, envious), and some people want to die for love </p>
<p>We know that due to the existence of the subconscious mind, the content of awareness is often just the tip of the iceberg </p>
<p>The pain of losing a relationship is not just as simple as losing someone<br>It often includes your longing for love, fantasy about the future, and even the disillusionment of your personal beliefs </p>
<p>Actually, you also know that she is not as perfect as you think, but she is indulged in fantasy and neglected subjectively.<br>Like the colorful soap bubbles in the sun, they are infinitely beautiful, and everything disappears after being punctured </p>
<p>In a very short time, all the good parts of life are taken away (at least you would think it is all)<br>This kind of thing comparable to subverting the Three Views is naturally heartache </p>
<p>You feel like being taken away from oxygen in your life, and your heart is empty<br>I usually force a smile in front of everyone, and only mention it in front of my close friends<br>If you are unlucky and self-conscious, knowing that you are disturbing others, you will often keep silent, and just say a few words and become silent.<br>When I was alone, the emptiness came again from all directions, and there was no escape </p>
<p>Congratulations, because at this time, you have encountered the ultimate problem of mankind and even the universe: loneliness </p>
<hr>
<p>From an economic point of view, we know that everything we paid to the goddess before is already a sunk cost </p>
<p>At this time, the scientific approach is: the heart is like steel to stop the loss in time, that is-there is a break, there is a rebirth! Strictly control the expansion of opportunity cost </p>
<p>The reality is that stock gods often only have so few </p>
<p>Because human emotions precede logic </p>
<p>It should be understood that most human emotions come from ancient animal brains, with short paths and fast reactions, which belong to the core level and have higher authority.<br>The new cortex, which is responsible for thinking, has a long path and slow response speed, which belongs to the application layer and has the lowest authority.<br>If you encounter amygdala robbery, cingulate back lock, etc., it will lead to insufficient permissions at the application layer and be rejected </p>
<p>At this point, people are completely controlled by emotions </p>
<p>Then the little mage is not willing to resurrect, we can understand </p>

    <title>How to heal yourself</title>
    <url>/Self-Healing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last time I analyzed some of the reasons behind, this time I talk about how to deal with it </p>
<p>First of all, there is no chance of redemption by default here, not that you can kneel in front of the goddess and cry, or make exaggerated things like crying, making trouble, and hanging yourself. </p>
<p>If you really did it and got it back, please refer to how to fall in love instead of the following </p>
<p>For individuals, how to get out of the predicament as soon as possible and minimize the loss is what we are most concerned about now </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>Okay, let’s first deal with the “preventive treatment” stage emphasized in the “Huangdi Neijing” </p>
<p>First of all, we must face our identity as a spare tire </p>
<p>Most people are often unwilling to admit this fact<br>For example, our little mage has been immersed in the fantasy with the goddess<br>For example, those retail investors who buy high and sell low </p>
<p>There is a concept in economics called <strong>path dependence</strong>, the official explanation is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once people make a certain choice, it is like embarking on a path of no return. The force of inertia will make this choice constantly self-reinforcing and prevent you from going out easily. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the QWERTY keyboard we are familiar with (I have used Dvorak for a few months, and it feels pretty cool, I don’t know if it’s in my heart) </p>
<p>“Suwen·Four Qi Tiao Shen Dalun” also mentioned: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not too late if the husband’s disease has become a disease and then the medicine, the chaos has become, and then he can be cured. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cultivate a sensitive heart, through some small things, see the little things, see through this layer of fantasy, instead of continuously indulging in it </p>
<p>Get out of the illusion, move towards maturity, cut the fetters, and break with the past self </p>
<p>Of course, if you have not been able to see the leopard in your eyes, and know the autumn when a leaf falls, don’t be too pessimistic. </p>
<p>After all, it is more difficult to get out of this illusion on your own.<br>This is tantamount to requiring a variable in the code to check for bugs, which is often unrealistic (for example, our little mage was awakened by violence when he encountered a face confession) </p>
<hr>
<p>Now let’s deal with the “it’s too late” situation </p>
<p>Some methods are widely circulated on the Internet, such as: </p>
<ol>
<li>Read a book that you have wanted to read for a long time </li>
<li>Go out and exercise </li>
<li>Tourism </li>
<li>Stay with friends and chat </li>
<li>Turn your attention away </li>
</ol>
<p>I have to say that these do have a certain effect, but they cannot solve the problem fundamentally. </p>
<p>When using these methods, I talked and laughed at the time, but from another angle, it might not be another illusion. </p>
<p>Because other people cannot and cannot stay with you all the time. When everyone is gone, the feeling of loneliness rushing toward you is like the force majeure defined in the law, which is unstoppable (the children who study abroad may have this experience) </p>
<p>So what should we do? </p>
<p>If you have seen <a href="http://v.163.com/movie/2012/9/P/4/M8I5TK339_M8KTJOSP4.html">Stanford University Open Class: How to Think Like a Psychologist-Can We Really Control Emotions</a>, should have some insight </p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous article, the human brain has various defects, but in fact, as long as the hardware bug is not triggered, it can often continue to run smoothly. </p>
<p>Subjectively, we feel that the brain is a single-core single-process. Forcing a large number of concurrency often means that intelligence and judgment are reduced overall, let alone parallel computing. </p>
<p>But we often do not realize or ignore the existence of system processes such as breathing and heartbeat </p>
<p>Due to the existence of the kernel or software and hardware protection mechanisms, if you want to metaprogram it yourself, it is often unrealistic to bypass the monitoring of the operating system (foreign objects such as drugs are not counted) </p>
<p>Based on this, we can try <code>fork</code> to create a new process, throw in all emotions such as sadness and disappointment, and then execute <code>disown %</code> instead of letting them occupy <code>fg</code>, thus affecting the routines of daily life </p>

    <title>Fanwai-chat</title>
    <url>/Side-Story/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It was just on impulse. I was watching ROR at the time. I didn’t know that the test should go first. In addition, it was all E texts. I didn’t know what I was doing at all. </p>
<p>In addition, I watched a video at that time, which basically said that the passengers kept asking the flight attendants why they can’t play with mobile phones on the handjob. The flight attendants kept explaining from a scientific point of view, and finally went crazy saying that you Muggles, handjobs are driven by magic, otherwise How did such a big thing fly into the sky? The aerodynamics and electromagnetics were made up by aliens to deceive you stupid humans… </p>
<p>Then I hurriedly started programming and magic is a bit similar. I usually listen to public lectures, and the professors often mention there’s no magic here. I rushed to the opposite, coded a lot of letters, and then I could run , Isn’t this amazing </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>I think if I can write 10, I will open a project on Github<br>Well, in fact, I should write 100 before I should review the magic horse </p>
<p>But I know I’m too lazy, I don’t know when I’m boring and don’t continue, so I’d better do this early. </p>
<p>I was surprised that I broke single digits<br>Much of it is due to the number of words in a chapter, enough for me to add up to 12345 </p>
<p>Fortunately, my goal for myself is very low, and it’s not a professional codeword. It’s good to have fun while writing. </p>
<p>Having said that, the coders are hard pressed, and it’s fine if you want to record something, and you don’t dare to show your face if you are not photogenic. You can only rely on <strong>plain text</strong>. </p>
<p>Looking at the literary and artistic youth, which one is not the photo of the food<br>Gap ╮(￣ ▽ ￣”)╭ </p>
<hr>
<p>Generally speaking, there are few midway actors in the novel who hang up on this kind of thing. If unfortunately, it is a great event. Either the protagonist changes suddenly and his skill soars by 100X like Saiyan; or there is a turning point in the plot. It’s the next generation’s turn to appear. For example, Zhang Cuishan and Zhang Wuji in “Evening the Dragon Slayer” have changed the protagonist; or, the author has changed, and it’s time to start anew (-_-|||) </p>
<p>Also, this kind of martial arts fantasy, the protagonist only gets stronger and stronger<br>Jin Daxia’s <em>Flying Snow shoots the White Deer, and the Laughing Man leaning on Bi Yuan</em> is such a pinnacle </p>
<p>When I was still watching “The Wilderness” in college, I was curious about this question, why is Jiangzi?<br>Like Tuobaye, at the end of “Sou Shen Ji”, he can already fight the immortal level. When “The Wilderness” is about to end, the mind of the three emperors and all the mess will be all, not to mention the bug-like Shi Nafang at the end. Hua<br>Of course, this is the end, and I can’t write any further </p>
<p>Of course, now I know that the golden style has a strong sense of substitution, and readers can grow with the growth of the protagonist, so that users’ <strong>return rate, stickiness, and loyalty</strong> are very high. I still see “Sculpture” after a few years. The impulse to sleep and forget </p>
<p>On the other hand, in Gulong’s works, it’s a god level, no need to fight monsters, driven by suspense reasoning, but I haven’t heard of any downgrade.<br>There seems to be no “reverse growth” model on the market </p>
<p>Then I asked a roommate who had broken ten thousand books. He said that out of all the fantasy he has seen, only one is weaker with practice. </p>
<p>I can imagine how surprised I was, so how about asking? He said what else could happen. The pig’s feet first killed the God Realm in seconds, and later became weaker and weaker. He was humiliated by opponents who had already abused him, and finally found that he could not beat even an ordinary person. </p>
<p>I felt melancholy after listening </p>
<p>Then he went on to say that the protagonist will be resurrected and reincarnated as XXX, starting from scratch, and will finally become the top and embrace the beauty(s). </p>
<p>If you don’t die, you won’t die </p>

<p>The reason behind it should be the fear of entering the next stage of life<br>You have to wait until your birthday is over before you can enter 24 </p>
<p>The other is also because the “Huangdi Neijing” puts men in an 8-year cycle<br>When I was 16 years old, I felt that I had changed significantly. This time I was swollen, and I was afraid<br>But 24 is still inevitable, and a few days have passed in the blink of an eye<del>~</del> </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h4 id="Gap-year"><a href="#Gap-year" class="headerlink" title="Gap year"></a>Gap year</h4><p>The earliest idea roughly came from that god post:<br>Complete computer in one year and linear algebra in one week<br>I can only say that after watching TM, I was shocked. I can still play like this. Okay. </p>
<p>I had no choice but to sell myself and clinked poorly<br>But I have been unwilling to do so, and I always want to find an opportunity to take half a year or a year to cool off </p>
<p>I originally planned to start planning in 1.5 years, but I thought that the opportunity would come so soon. </p>
<ol>
<li>Boss quit </li>
<li>The new project manager engages in office politics (after I flashed, everyone has left more than half) </li>
<li>The project belongs to the death plan in “The Myth of Man-Month”, and there is no rush </li>
<li>The landlord wants to renovate the room paper, shove people out… </li>
<li>A little bit of hard-earned money </li>
</ol>
<p>It felt like an invisible hand was pushing me<br>In this case, go with the weather and resolutely refuse to continue selling cheap labor </p>
<h4 id="parents"><a href="#parents" class="headerlink" title="parents"></a>parents</h4><p>Mom and Dad are the kind of old-fashioned ones, as mentioned in the blog<br>So they heard that I quit my job or didn’t look for a job. They were speechless. </p>
<p>In this regard, I feel that I am doing eight wrong<br>I’m independent, and I have done something that seems to be brain-dead to them for a period of time, and I haven’t quarreled with them before, and don’t add to the fact that I beat me every day. </p>
<p>The Chinese New Year should be miserable in principle. If you don’t have a wife, you don’t have a job yet.<br>As a result, I stayed until the Lantern Festival and then left, my sister-in-law was shocked </p>
<h4 id="Cheese-is-power"><a href="#Cheese-is-power" class="headerlink" title="Cheese is power"></a>Cheese is power</h4><p>Although I studied full-time, it’s a pity that I have read 100 books for most of the year. What are you doing? I’m not too satisfied. </p>
<p>But having said that, it should not be measured by this number<br>Maybe some people can enlighten the way in a few books, but some people don’t read a book. </p>
<h4 id="Blog"><a href="#Blog" class="headerlink" title="Blog"></a>Blog</h4><p>Github is finally up, markdown writes stuff<br>I opened a brain damage series, let’s code slowly </p>
<p>But I found that there is really little written in programming </p>
<p>That ￣ △ ￣ Am I really a programmer? </p>
<p>Although there are all kinds of doubts, I even tricked a kid as an apprentice </p>
<h4 id="life"><a href="#life" class="headerlink" title="life"></a>life</h4><p>I bought rMBP and finally don’t use the Ghost system every day (Xcode dragged it until now…)<br>I got my friend’s mini and felt very good. I immediately got an Air. After using it for a month, I found that I was really reading books and didn’t play games…<br>When 6 comes out, the whole line will be replaced by Apple<br>I usually watch movies with my friends, eat barbecue, enjoy the sun on the balcony and read a book </p>
<h4 id="At-last"><a href="#At-last" class="headerlink" title="At last"></a>At last</h4><p>It’s a pity that there is always an end<br>To quote Russell: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a chance, I am willing to do it again </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2014-01-10-23-32-33"><a href="#2014-01-10-23-32-33" class="headerlink" title="2014-01-10 23:32:33"></a>2014-01-10 23:32:33</h3><p>I remember the summary of last year, I said, it was the year I grew the most, and it seems that I will say that again this year<br>Some unfinished things are still unfinished, and it is not possible to look at the end of the year and break through with one effort </p>
<p>Looking back at the past two years of graduation, it feels like living anew<br>Of course, the actual process is gradual and linear. If there is a sudden change, it is estimated to be the second personality. </p>
<p>The former me can’t be summed up as stupid </p>
<p>Want to come because: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who are good in ancient times will be foolish </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, I came into contact with a lot of magical concepts, I am willing to believe that these things are true </p>
<p>Having nothing to do, I reviewed the mind map, mostly one or six months ago </p>
<p>Found a few points: </p>
<ol>
<li>A problem was raised and no solution was directly contacted </li>
<li>Some learning theories are incorrect or not suitable for me </li>
<li>Unrealistic goals </li>
<li>Some nodes have been completed (so happy O(∩_∩)O~~) </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2013-12-31-23-46-22"><a href="#2013-12-31-23-46-22" class="headerlink" title="2013-12-31 23:46:22"></a>2013-12-31 23:46:22</h3><p>This…what about a good summary? ? ?<br>Face slap again<br>The previous list is not finished<br>I brushed Ruby on Codecademy in the evening, I thought it would be next year soon. It’s not 100%, it’s up, no matter the EP, I’ve been brushing it until just now, 12 Pomodori<br>But, sometimes, it’s not that you can make a breakthrough with the first steel. It’s not scientific </p>
<p>It is said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who know how to give up don’t care too much about the gains and losses in front of them. They have a broad mind and vision… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forget it, it’s pointless to lie to yourself<br>Don’t say anything, Sang Xin, I’m asleep, and I have to grab the ticket tomorrow… </p>
<p>This is not over, we will fight again in two days, and continue<br>To Be Continue… </p>

<h3 id="2013-12-20"><a href="#2013-12-20" class="headerlink" title="2013-12-20"></a>2013-12-20</h3><p>The head hurts these few days. I have seen that 2013 is about to pass. A few days ago, I was going to do the finishing work, not adding more tasks, but now, just looking at the finishing touches, it is very much.<br>Especially after the mac arrived, all kinds of familiarity, another two days delay </p>
<p>Quickly list the To-Do list and get them out of your head </p>
<ul>
<li>Infuriating operation </li>
<li>Wing Chun: Marking </li>
<li>More than ten unfinished books </li>

<p>There was a miscalculation last time, which caused Luzhu to think that fast reading was done<br>After the correction, I know the truth. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>After buying Air, I stupidly spent a few months reading<br>I discovered Game Center only two days ago, no wonder people say that the iPad is used to play games<br>Uncollectible for two days<br>Then I thought about the reward mechanism of the game, and the irritability of reading </p>
<p>I remember where I said that reading is a long-term reward process, so the hourly unit cannot feel rewarded<br>Blindly saying that internal drive is an abuse of willpower </p>
<p>If the subconscious doesn’t understand this, it feels boring and controls you to do other things </p>
<p>I feel that after breaking through 1k or more, I will be internalized into the habit. I shouldn’t care about this anymore, but it’s especially uncomfortable at this stage of several hundred (╯﹏╰) </p>
<p>So I wonder if there is a kind of visualization<br>It’s similar to KPI, purely used<br>And the number of pages in the book is easier to quantify </p>
<p>Then I used omniplan and Gantt chart for a long time, but it didn’t look what I wanted. </p>
<p>I was angry and wanted to write it myself and make it into a website or ios app. Later I found that Excel was enough… </p>
<p>Does the programmer mode make wheels for yourself at every turn… </p>
<p>Thinking out of box </p>

    <title>Dream interpretation</title>
    <url>/The-Interpretation-of-Dreams/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The little mage found himself doing some tricks<br>The needle is stuck on the back of the hand, inside the red blood needle tube<br>Without thinking, I pressed the C (pause?) key </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I breathe tightly, and I feel choked instantly. It feels like I am in a vacuum, and the air in my body leaks out of the pinhole.<br>The little mage was terrified and hurriedly pressed the pause button again </p>
<p>After about a few seconds, the little mage took a sigh of relief and finally felt that he could breathe.<br>He took a few deep breaths. Before he thought that “If you die in a catastrophe, you will have a blessing.” He discovered a serious problem-no heartbeat </p>
<p>This time, the little mage was scared<br>Oh my god, how could this happen, the little mage thought to himself, there is breathing but no pulse, what’s the matter with swelling? </p>
<p>Acute cardiac arrest is one of the most important causes of death in the elves<br>Fortunately, the little mage was in the celestial dynasty, he did not give up the treatment, and proceeded to perform CPR on himself. At this time, he was already lying on the bed. </p>
<p>However, there are several key points for high-quality CPR: </p>
<ul>
<li>Compression rate is at least 100 compressions per minute </li>
<li>Adults compress at least 5 cm </li>
<li>Ensure chest rebound after each compression </li>
<li>Minimize the interruption of chest compressions </li>
<li>Avoid hyperventilation </li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the current situation of the little mage is simply a joke </p>
<p>In addition, no blood circulation means that there is no energy exchange with oxygen, and the body’s activities gradually stop.<br>But I can move, still doing chest compressions on myself, and have such a clear will<br>Although the little mage was puzzled, he did not stop to treat himself. </p>
<p>Working hard for a while, then he woke up… </p>
<p>It’s late at night, and there’s no sound around it<br>Whenever he has a nightmare, when the little mage wakes up, he often finds that his hand is pressed against the position of the heart, but this time it is on the right. </p>
<hr>
<p>I think that when I was in the first grade of the Master Academy, the little mage was exposed to hypnosis, and he was very relaxed and comfortable after doing it. Later, I listened to it once before going to bed every night, and the quality of sleep soared. </p>
<p>By chance, the little mage turned to an ancient book <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1201821/">Uncover the mystery of the human mind</a><br>It’s a pity that this book is too thick. When the deadline for returning the book is reached, the little mage can only read half of it </p>
<p>But the cheats are the cheats. For example, Mei Chaofeng only got half of the Jiuyin Scripture, which is enough to kill Qiu Chuji and other old ways in seconds. </p>
<p>The little mage was stunned by Freund’s Oedipus theory, but “the dream is to achieve a certain wish” inspired him<br>Some dreams can be found out by themselves </p>
<p>Thanks to the seemingly scientific explanation, coupled with the bonus of hypnosis halo, the little mage’s dreams gradually disappear </p>
<p>PS: A few years later, the little mage flipped through this book again, read the remaining half, and saw the description of controlling dreams, although only one sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people can clearly know that they are sleeping and dreaming at night, so they seem to have the ability to guide dreams with their will. For example, when this kind of dreamer is not satisfied with the dream, he can interrupt the dream without waking up, and then start in a new direction. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little mage can only sigh that good luck makes people, it is very close to this, if you insisted on going through it back then, you might not have made so many detours.<br>There is another thing in the same way, I will talk about it later when I have a chance [pit] </p>

    <title>Multiple sleep</title>
    <url>/Polyphasic-Sleep/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/7067548/">Powerful Sleep</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that they have slept too much, and their mental state is as bad as their sleep quality. This happens because they are not aware of the potential energy and sleep mechanism in their body (Energy and sleep mechanism) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence points out a long, long time ago, the little mage sometimes slept for 10 hours, but when he woke up he felt tired, sleepy, and lack of energy. </p>
<p>Cheese is power<br>After that, the little mage made appropriate adjustments according to his Deep sleep and REM cycle, and strengthened the light (note that it is melatonin, not photosynthesis) </p>
<p>Even under the strong work of Yali, the quality of sleep improves linearly </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>Later, the little mage learned about the magical [Da Vinci Sleep](<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%9A%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%E7%9D%">http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%9A%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%E7%9D%</a> A1%E7%9C%A0), also known as polyphasic sleep </p>
<p>At that time, the little mage was rather silly, so he actually tried it, and the result directly led to a sluggish work during the day.<br>If he had seen <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/3662227/">Private Myth</a>, he would not have done such stupid things </p>
<p>In fact, NREM REM has its irreplaceable effect<br>First of all, REM is not a human patent. It occurs in mammals and birds. Second, it may be expressed as “feeling” in the NREM stage, so although there is no dream at this time, it does not mean that it can be shortened at will. </p>
<p>At the same time, some of the warriors who have tried this are mostly based on the month. It seems that there has not been a chestnut that has been successful for ten years. </p>
<p>However, the little mage was inspired by a child’s paper 6 + 3 * 20′ that used this method to test the TOEFL (6 hours at night, 20 minutes in three periods during the day), and perfected his own method </p>
<p>So that afterwards, there was no dream </p>
<hr>
<p>Ordinarily, the little mage should be happy. At this time, he can go into deep sleep smoothly through <strong>hypnosis</strong> [pit, fill in the back], and after waking up, his whole body is loose, as if he has opened up the eight meridians of the odd meridian [pit] </p>
<p>But the little mage is still depressed. Not having a dream for several months is equivalent to missing a skill, and this kind of thing has not happened before, it is hard not to doubt whether there is something wrong with his human brain. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the little mage can already see how his subconscious is doing something magical based on Freud’s dream interpretation theory.<br>But now there is no dream, how can this be explained? Could it be that the little mage has no desires and desires? </p>
<p>The little mage was confused for a long time, until he saw <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1316093/">Beyond Inferiority Complex</a> </p>
<p>Adler mentioned in the study of dreams in individual psychology: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the meaning of dreams is to leave certain feelings in life, we often find people who don’t want to be swayed by feelings. Most of the time, they only believe in science. People of this type are less likely to dream. People don’t even dream at all. </p>
<p>Any solution provided in the dream is actually worse than the solution you think about when you are awake. To put it another way, that is to say, when dreaming, the individual is tantamount to solving problems in the process of sleeping. This is not excessive. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little mage was relieved, and quickly took notes to strengthen his memory </p>
<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t know that due to the early age of these books, the authors belonged to semi-blind people who touched the elephant in the dark. Everyone thought that they had touched the whole elephant, but in fact they only touched the trunk, legs, and tail. As a pioneer, Ephesus was not spared, apparently only touching the reproductive organs of elephants. </p>
<p>As for Jiangzi, the little mage has always been complacent about being a “person who does not want to be influenced by feelings”.<br>Until he came into contact-Qingmingmeng </p>

<p>This is equivalent to the computer environment, test some usage </p>
<p>After getting familiar with the above two steps, you can already write something for fun<br>For example, Luzhu wrote a web version of the Zhihu Daily homepage, click <a href="http://zhihudaily.ahorn.me/">here</a><br>Some of the development at that time and the source code are here <a href="https://github.com/leihao0/GO-ZhihuDaily">here</a> </p>
<p>Of course, Github is another skill </p>
</li>
<li><p>Frame, <a href="https://github.com/go-martini/martini">Martini</a> for dewdrop </p>
<p>The framework feels like another thing, even if you can speak it, the framework based on this voice will still take time to learn. For example, Ruby itself is completely covered by ROR. </p>
<p>So when I opened it, I didn’t expect to use the framework. Later, I wrote that I found that the routing magic must be realized by myself. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are various discussions on performance, so I won’t talk about it </p>
<p>Humanware is the most important thing, so from a programmer’s point of view, Golang is still very good. It is a static voice and can be written like a dynamic language to some extent, except for the pain of Json conversion and the constant checkerr. Outside (I’m really not black it!!!) </p>
<p>Well, I came here after using a bit of Ruby. Ruby is so cool that I feel all kinds of uncomfortable after turning around. </p>

    <title>Lucid dream</title>
    <url>/Lucid-Dream/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have to say that this world is really amazing. What you don’t know doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. </p>
<p>After the little mage read the magic post of “Teach You How to Control Dreams”, the whole person was stunned.<br>The previous Inception was completely regarded as a movie, and I forgot after watching it. I didn’t expect it to have a realistic basis.<br>Really an expert watch the doorway, the layman watch the excitement<br>Because of my own stupidity, the unforgettable things like ghost press never appeared again </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>PS: The prototype of Inception seems to be Yasuhiro Tsutsui <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/4887589/">Dream Detective</a>. If you don’t have time, you can watch the adapted anime movie [Red Pepper](http:// movie.douban.com/subject/1865703/)<br>However, I still recommend novels, because it describes the non-deterministic polynomial (NP) problem from the shallower to the deeper, and gives many examples </p>
<p>After that, the little mage kept on Google, found Baidu Lucid Dream Post Bar, and saw the children on the end of the world, you may “miss a wonderful world”, and then go to the dream space of ants<br>If none of these can convince him, he saw in TED, [The feelings of the doctor of Harvard Neuroscience Department after stroke](<a href="http://v.163.com/movie/2013/3/6/B/M92INA100_M92INHT6B">http://v.163.com/movie/2013/3/6/B/M92INA100_M92INHT6B</a> .html) </p>
<p>Why is the little mage so excited?<br>Not only because Qingming Dream can be played as a large-scale 3D game, the most important thing is: it is said that if you control the dream, you can do anything and everything in the dream (✧≖´◞౪◟≖ ｀) </p>
<p>The little mage immediately started the experiment, and succeeded several times afterwards, all of which were recorded in detail, excerpt </p>
<hr>
<p>the first time: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the retreat to sleep, hug Benben, look at the software, the six-pointed star, three conversion methods (trigger! Actually, it’s already asleep, otherwise the notebook from somewhere in the middle of the night), slap on the bed, and the pores all over, As if they were all opened, they got up immediately! ! !<br>Out of body? It’s only the third day, I was excited, and found myself back in my body…<br>Then I saw that I was a white glowing Dongdong, with limbs + body, no hands and feet, but the end was arc-shaped. Is this an energy state? Then I can’t get out no matter what, the next step is not to open my eyes<br>Then I opened my eyes and found that the door to the balcony was open. It was a bit scary to know the sound of horses and horses outside. It was probably scared. I really woke up and found that the door was closed properly. The outside was dark and nothing. Sound<br>Continuing to take out the notebook, the whole body is numb again…<br>The vague memory below is going to the karaoke hall, back to school, buses, taxis, repairing electric wires, it has become an ordinary dream… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next time: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my dream, I was in school. I thought of holding down ctrl and I could fly. Shift was to accelerate, and then I played for a long time under weightlessness.<br>Then there is a Q version of the small animal competition. I was about to fly, and suddenly the green small animal became Makolov (Modern Warfare 3), or T-bag (Prison Break)… He wanted to catch me , I just drifted away… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some, such as:<br>Jobs’s “your time is limited” taught the little mage a heavy lesson in his dream<br>And in the dream, the unclear relationship for the university has completed the closed loop, and can continue to move forward<br>And the dream mentioned in Uncovering the Mystery of the Human Mind, the little mage often wonders what is the meaning of living, so he will give him a little bit in the dream and kill him to let Ya know how wonderful it is to live. </p>
<p>##method<br>There are a lot of online games, each with its own way of playing. In fact, you only need to master the core ideas: <strong>Dream in a dream, then control dream</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>When you wake up in the morning, you must record your dreams. Even if you can’t remember any dreams, you must write and draw.<br>Normal short-term memory is cleared in 5 minutes, so if you don’t record the dream immediately, the dream will be forgotten instantly </li>
<li>In daily life, remind yourself, “Am I dreaming?”<br>Habits can be brought into dreams. The principle can be referred to: <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/20507212/">The power of habit-why do we live like this and work like this? </a> </li>
</ol>
<p>For details, please refer to <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/4740779/">Dream Guide-Analyzing the Mysterious Qingming Dream</a> </p>
<p>It also describes a state that may be more advanced than lucid dreams: dreamlessness, that is, the state of pure consciousness. </p>
<p>PS：<br>The dreamless here is not the kind of little mage who sleeps till dawn on the island of Phuket after hypnotizing.<br>It may be the state of being completely present in the “Power of the Present”<br>In addition, when the brain evolved REM, no words were produced yet, so our dreams are often presented in the form of images </p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, even if it’s Zhimeng, I still can’t help feeling that kind of fear, such as the situation where the body is cold, the whole body is transparent, and one arm is broken.<br>It’s even more terrifying if it’s the scenes of your daily life, such as strange sounds, monsters and skeletons<br>Because of the Fight-or-flight rooted in human genes, it’s hard for you not to wake up at this time </p>
<p>Because - in case it’s true! </p>
<p>In the Don Juan series <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/4199618/">The Art of Dreaming</a>, the Qingming Dream is described as another world, but our daily life is illusory<br>It sounds a bit like Avalon-the ideal home for heroic souls to rest </p>
<p>Although it sounds nonsense, but Zhuang Shengxiao dreams of butterflies, who knows which world is real? </p>
<h2 id="The-truth-is-always-one"><a href="#The-truth-is-always-one" class="headerlink" title="The truth is always one"></a>The truth is always one</h2><p>Having said so much, in Conan’s words: There is only one truth </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a monthly income of more than 50,000, consider mid-range travel in Europe and America<br>Monthly income of 30,000 can consider low-end European travel<br>Monthly income of 10,000 to 20,000, please choose Southeast Asia tour<br>Monthly income is less than 10,000, please choose domestic travel<br>Monthly income is less than five thousand, please choose the province tour<br>Please choose an outing with a monthly income of 3000<br>Please choose peanut oil for less than two thousand<br>Less than one thousand, please choose the trench tour<br><strong>If you have no income</strong>, please choose <strong>Sleepwalking</strong>!<br>Happy May Day everyone! </p>

    <title>Sleep paralysis</title>
    <url>/Sleep-Paralysis/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Once, when the little mage was still a magic apprentice in the magic academy, he experienced twice [Ghost Press](<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E7">http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E7</a> %98%AB%E7%97%AA%E7%97%87*) </p>
<p>It’s been four years since the first time. The little mage at the time didn’t even know that it was called a “ghost press”, but was completely at a loss and defined it as a “spiritual event.” </p>
<p>Let’s go back to four years ago, (in parentheses is the analysis using the theory of “Dream Explanation”): </p>
<p>At that time the little mage came back from shopping at noon and went to sleep for a nap<br>Plus he was having a cold and was very uncomfortable, so the little mage continued to use hypnotherapy<br>As mentioned before, after the little mage uses this method, he has no trouble dreaming, and hasn’t had any problems for almost two years. </p>
<p>And this time he will eat a pound </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>The little mage slowly relaxed, and suddenly he found that he had introspection ability (<em>Taoist practice can see the internal organs</em>), and when he scanned his stomach he saw a huge tumor.<br>Dizzy, the little mage thought to himself, this is a terminal illness, and then the picture is reduced, the previous one is the elephant that has been enlarged many times (<em>High School Biology Book in Tumor Cells</em>) </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>When he was conscious again, the little mage found himself on the bridge of a lake (<em>a map of a local lake</em>)<br>Suddenly a picture of a hand extending from the water flashes (<em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>)<br>When crossing over half of the lake from the bridge, there was a riot on the right, as if someone fell into the water.<br>Then I saw a child in the water (<em>When the little mage passed by a certain door when he was young, the little friend said that it was haunted inside, and he must not look inside (*Never imagine the pink elephant</em>), otherwise he would have a ghost. Then the little mage would I looked inside and caught a glimpse of an unforgettable picture*)<br>The little mage went down an arc to a ship, and the picture of his hand extending from the water flashed again. Then he flew up or fell into the water? The screen is tilted about 90 degrees (<em>CS died and fell from upstairs &amp; “I fell into the water last time”-Angel Beats</em>) </p>
<p>After that, the little mage got entangled with that thing. I don’t know how long it has passed, it may be instantaneous<br>Then he felt numb all over his body and buzzing in his head (<em>the kind of UFO that appeared in the movie is actually brain waves</em>) </p>
<p>The little mage is terrified, there is a horror of being possessed by a ghost and about to be occupied<br>He always wanted to get rid of it, and tried to shine the sun on it three times, only the last time came out a red flame with a little grimace (<em>Warcraft Flame Lord’s Lava Creature</em>)<br>At this time, the buzzing sound is getting louder and louder, and the whole body is getting numb </p>
<p>I don’t know if he came up with it himself or the person rescuing next to him reminded: Just open your eyes.<br>This is undoubtedly a life-saving straw, the little mage desperately did it, but he seems to have no control over his body, he is paralyzed all over, and even unable to open his eyes.<br>At that time, the little mage had only one feeling: “If you don’t open your eyes, it will be a plant.”<br>After trying hard several times, he finally opened his right eye and saw the ceiling of the dormitory. It was only dim, and the phantoms and phantoms disappeared immediately, and he realized that he was taking a nap. </p>
<p>Although there was “Dream Explanation” to withstand, some of them were beyond the explanation of the little mage, and a series of questions were raised:<br>If they are all illusions, why is the whole body paralyzed?<br>After waiting for a long time, he was able to control his arm to take off the earphones, and he didn’t have to think about how his body should be exercised. It could move according to our consciousness.<br>Can mental activity cause physical damage?<br>In addition, it was more than 3 o’clock at the time. Although it belonged to the yin of the sun in a day, the ghosts did not escape.<br>And what happens if you don’t open your eyes? Lost consciousness? For that thing, the little mage didn’t feel any emotions, and it had no spiritual impact on him.<br>Is it still stuck in his mind, or has he gone out? Or is it a part of him? </p>
<p>In short, the experience of ghost press is strange and peculiar, especially the first time, without scientific guidance, it is difficult not to make ghost associations.<br>The little mage has been puzzled for a while since then, a few weeks later he experienced it again<br>With the first experience, the little mage quickly opened his eyes and thought he was done. </p>
<p>After a while, the little mage brushed the Q domain, and suddenly found that Tiantianfa sent a public account that he was planning to block and posted an article:<br>Teach you how to control dreams [Super technology] </p>
<p>Little Mage is completely stupid </p>
<hr>
<p>PS:<br>In fact, the answer that really convinces the little mage is in <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/5375620/">Out of Control-The Final Fate and Ending of All Mankind</a> This book is inconsistent with Mengbagan, in which The chapter from All Fools into Wisdom says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans have a brain, but it is neither centralized nor central<br>… Consciousness emerges from a distributed network of many tiny and unconscious neural circuits </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a quote from “The Society of Mind” (The Society of Mind): A paragraph from Marvin Mins’s philosophy and humanities book published in 1988: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human mental activities and any naturally evolved perception systems are a large society composed of individual simple processes completed by countless “busy beings”-like agents. Various mental phenomena emerge from the highly connected interaction mechanism of the brain. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make an inaccurate analogy, the human brain is probably like a GPU, with a lot of computing units. Everyone is in charge of their own affairs, and together they form the current “you”.<br>And when sleeping, if the part of the consciousness cell is running while the part that controls the body is dormant, it will probably lead to the horrible phenomenon of feeling awake but unable to control the body (stroke patients?) </p>

    <title>Straight to heaven</title>
    <url>/Highway-to-Heaven/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Charles Dickens, the greatest British writer of the Victorian era, said in A Tale of Two Cities: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the best era and the worst era;<br>This is the age of wise, this is the age of ignorance;<br>This is the era of trust, this is the era of doubt;<br>This is the season of light, this is the season of darkness;<br>This is the spring of hope, this is the winter of disappointment;<br>We have everything, we have nothing;<br>Here goes straight to heaven, here goes straight to hell </p>
</blockquote>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Of course this article has little to do with this passage<br>The reason why it is quoted here is just that these sentences are catchy to read &amp; crazy and cool. </p>
<p>But the little mage did leave and went to heaven </p>
<p>I have to sigh the rapid development of the celestial dynasty. Two years ago, when the little mage went to heaven from two fat papers, there was only K series.<br>In fact, there was no G system at that time, it was just like Dante’s “Divine Comedy”, the route was divided into: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inferno (Inferno)-‎ Purgatory (Purgatory)-‎ Paradise (Paradise) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before going to heaven, the little mage has to go to the magic city. Not to mention that the price is several times more expensive, but it can actually be ＞= K series </p>
<p>Once back to the city, the friend bought a hard seat in order to save money, and successfully lured the young master into the pit<br>Originally, the little mage tried too hard while practicing magic in the mage academy, which caused some minor problems in the lumbar spine.<br>It turned out to be good. The 6 hours of continuous bumps almost broke the thin waist of the little mage.<br>From then on, the little mage vowed to lie down as long as he has a ticket </p>
<p>I don’t want to have a direct G series after a year, quiet, fast and clean, and the voyage is shortened to 2.5 hours </p>
<p>But even with Jiangzi, it’s quite boring on the train<br>In the past, the little wizards always brought books or read them directly on the phone, but this time with the code artifact, it is naturally very different </p>
<p>However, the little mage is still more worried, and has been hesitant to sacrifice the artifact. After all, there are some ordinary artifacts around, such as the plague and death. </p>
<p>In fact, the little mage has also used and used this ordinary magic weapon for a long time, from the ancient eh thirsty skin to the latest type of plague, let’s die, and spend more than 1k days and nights with the little mage </p>
<p>That’s really a good memory, the little mage’s waist started to wear out at that time, so let’s talk about it later if I have a chance. </p>
<p>In fact, the little mage worry is completely redundant, because: </p>
<p>The little mage in the eyes of the little mage:<br>Wow, I got the artifact at a young age, this guy is not easy<br>The little mage in the eyes of others:<br>A hard-working programmer, I have to fix the bug on the train </p>
<hr>
<p>Tips: </p>
<p>There is an experiment:<br>Let others help to see things, can reduce the probability of being stolen<br>I don’t know whether it’s true or not, but the little mage often uses it<br>The passers-by are also very helpful, there has not been a black swan incident </p>
<hr>
<p>Before, the little mage asked a little partner to find a farmer’s house in his community, temporarily for a month as a transition </p>
<p>Then he knew what is called the struggle of the ants and what is called Bei Diao </p>
<p>That environment…<br>That noise…<br>That smell… </p>
<p>In addition, the shops here, as if they had been discussed, closed one after another, each time there was a loud noise, giving the little mage continuous and continuous stimulation.<br>One after another, more than the snoring of the little mage’s dormitory. </p>
<p>At three in the morning, the last store was finally closed<br>Little Mage thought he could finally sleep this time<br>Just lying down, there was a loud noise again, and the little mage was surprised to find that selling early shops began to open the door one after another. </p>
<hr>
<p>The little mage has a good mental plan, thinking that he has read so many poems and books this year, and one month is not enough. </p>
<p>If he has watched the eighth episode of the documentary “Why Poverty?” produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) in collaboration with documentary directors from various countries [“Reading to Poverty”](<a href="https://www.youtube">https://www.youtube</a> .com/watch?v=tcMzVgurk-0), it should not be so naive </p>
<p>Sure enough, after the little mage made a fierce shot, a few days later, the result was gratifying<br>There are only two interview calls, the conversion rate is less than 20%, and the interviewer has been hung up<br>This one is also said to be miscellaneous, lacking advantage, boring, and empty thoughts, and the most important thing is that it is still disgusted with spells. </p>
<p>The little mage didn’t eat dinner when he was heartbroken. He quietly returned to the peasant’s room and went to read Laozi’s “Tao De Jing”.<br>Use that sentence repeatedly: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Misfortune, where the blessing rests; Fortune, where the misfortune lies </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come to comfort myself </p>

    <title>How to install reaver on Mac OS X</title>
    <url>/how-to-install-reaver-on-mac-os-x/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Update: 2017-05-24 09:03:10 </p>
<p>Sorry, this post, I didn’t realize its ** danger before. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>In October last year, my network was overdue, and I re-avered the wifi that was used temporarily during the National Day holiday that the new network needed. </p>
<p>When I played the <em>Open Yale Course-Listening to Music</em> on the NAS, I found that my TV (Android system) had a subtitle that said “This website is for my personal use only. Do you have any problems?”. </p>
<p>I was taken aback by this sentence. My NAS has a PandoraBox system. I use it as a bridge. Normally, my TV shouldn’t appear on their router. Obviously, I found that this wifi was a fishing wifi, and my TV was hacked. </p>
<p>So, if some stupid applications are still using http, all my data will be exposed. Even https has a problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MitM</a>. ‘The product says iOS and macOS have a login trust certificate in the Keychain, but what is Android? Some devices have their own back door. </p>
<p>As for my TV, I think it uses <code>adb connect &lt;TV IP address&gt;</code> which is <em>Android Debug Bridge (adb) Wireless Debugging Over Wi-Fi</em>. </p>
<p>However, I later changed most of the passwords. </p>
<p>So, you can try the reaver of technical exploration, but <strong>cannot use it</strong>. </p>
<hr>
<p>Update: 2015-07-27 13:14:32 </p>
<p>I wrote it on 2014-05-11, but it was a year late, and now you can easily install reaver with <code>Homebrew</code>. </p>
<figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">brew install reaver</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Thanks Rustam for the suggestion </p>
<hr>
<p>I always use beini in vmware, and every time I plug in an extra USB wireless adapter to my computer. </p>
<p>When I had a Mac, I just copied beini’s VMX from Windows to the Mac, which meant I still had to use a wireless adapter. </p>
<p>In fact, <code>minidwep</code> or <code>inflator</code> all use the powerful tool <code>Reaver</code>… you know), while Mac is a unix-based system, you can run <code>Reaver</code> directly. </p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3tHnfnS08GycG1fVENETEdvazA/edit">reaver-osx.zip</a><br>(Tips: The original reaver-1.4 cannot use <code>make</code> directly on Mac) </li>
<li>Unzip reaver-osx.zip. </li>
</ol>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">cd</span> reaver-wps/src/</span><br><span class="line">./configure</span><br><span class="line">make</span><br><span class="line">sudo make install</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Enjoy, don’t do bad things :-) </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Developer-account-application"><a href="#Developer-account-application" class="headerlink" title="Developer account application"></a>Developer account application</h2><p>In the middle, I was delayed by providing photos and caught up with the trend of <code>Swift</code>, but it only took 4-5 days and the efficiency was still very high. </p>
<p>At first I thought I would use a dual currency credit card.<br>As the result, the times are advancing, and now (2014) ordinary credit cards will do, so it is very convenient </p>
<p>PS:<br>99$ == 688 ￥?<br>Because I have to pay taxes… </p>
<p>Maybe my account transferred the E text, and all the returned Emails were E texts, among them there is a sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>we’ll need a PDF copy of your government-issued photo ID. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a long time to understand that the <code>government-issued ID</code> turned out to be an ID card… </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I didn’t think too much about this extra delay. As a result, I went to China Unicom’s official website to buy a card two days ago, and the phone feedback knew the reason. </p>
<p>The reason for this weird thing is: transfer of account…<br>China Unicom reported that the information could not be queried through the ID number (why is this?)<br>PS: China Unicom is also quite weird. It was sent to a QQ mailbox. At first I thought it was a liar… </p>
<h2 id="How-to-list"><a href="#How-to-list" class="headerlink" title="How to list"></a>How to list</h2><p>Reference <a href="http://my.oschina.net/u/1245365/blog/201920">here</a><br>Very detailed, basic step by step comparison </p>

<p>See <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/kafeidev/article/details/8250051">here</a><br>The interface is not the same, but a closer look will pass </p>

<p>Then just wait, it will take another 4-5 days~ Don’t call back (&gt;_&lt;) </p>
<hr>
<p>2014-07-01<br>Waited for seven days, then was rejected, it was a tragedy… </p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don’t have time to take a closer look at the moment, just throw it away… </p>

    <url>/count-lines-of-code/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When I was reading <em>iOS 7 programming recipe</em>, I suddenly thought of how many lines of Obj-c code I wrote. </p>
<p>Earlier when I was still in the Windows operating system, I used <a href="https://code.google.com/p/boomworks/">SourceCounter</a> to do this. </p>
<p>But <a href="https://code.google.com/p/boomworks/">SourceCounter</a> does not support Mac OS X. </p>
<p>So, I found an interesting command line: </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">find . -name <span class="string">&quot;*.m&quot;</span> -or -name <span class="string">&quot;*.h&quot;</span> | xargs grep -v <span class="string">&quot;^$&quot;</span> | wc -l</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<a id="more"></a>

<p>“^ \ $” Blank line<br>“wc -l” is the number of words </p>
<p>I would recommend another tool written by <code>Perl</code>. </p>

<a id="more"></a>

<p>When I first worked one or two years ago, I went to play in the room paper rented by the small group, and found that a girl decorated her cabin with all kinds of things and it was very warm </p>
<p>At that time, my income was nearly twice as much as hers, and looking at our living space and way, it really seems like the other way around<br>I immediately realized that the quality of life and the correlation coefficient of income are not proportional, or at least not as originally thought. </p>
<p>I know that those posts are so long. I read them for a long time a while ago, but I haven’t finished reading them. I chose some according to my needs: </p>

<p>I thought that the keyboard + touchpad that comes with rMBP would be enough </p>
<p>As a result, I used Filco to hit Warcraft, and coded the code again<br>After switching back to my notebook, the difference immediately came out-if I press it quickly, the keycap will not bounce softly (poisoned…) </p>
<p>The legendary ** static capacitive keyboard**: HHKB or Realforce<br>But HHKB does not have F1, Realforce is so ugly… </p>
<p>Also, I want Mao to be silent, the office is noisy, okay? Besides, I still have QC 20<br>In addition, I like the keyboard crashing when playing Warcraft. The magnetic levitation keyboard is still in concept, naturally it is mechanical </p>
<p>Filco looks wrong<br>The 67 keys are weird. The most important thing is that you can’t choose a hero ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah<br>104’s keypad is not needed<br>So just 87 myself </p>

<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="Suitable-for-the-crowd"><a href="#Suitable-for-the-crowd" class="headerlink" title="Suitable for the crowd:"></a>Suitable for the crowd:</h2><p>Generally speaking, the <code>Cookbook</code> series are analogous to dictionaries. There is no need to go through the top and bottom of what is used and what to look up. </p>
<p>But after brushing it again, the benefits of building the relevant <strong>knowledge system</strong> are obvious </p>
<p>Not suitable: </p>
<ol>
<li>noob </li>
<li>Senior iOS Developer </li>
</ol>
<p>Novices can read these two books first:<br><a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/6959487/">Head First iPhone and iPad Development</a><br><a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/24538384/">The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a> </p>
<h2 id="method"><a href="#method" class="headerlink" title="method:"></a>method:</h2><ol>
<li><p>First of all, be prepared for collapse →_→<br>Think about how many children’s shoes back to the abandon’s dictionary and kneel down </p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the chapters that are <strong>key</strong>, that is, the chapters related to your current work <strong>look at it without missing a word</strong><br>Since the stuff you see can be used immediately, the effect is better<br>The non-code parts are the principles and tips, so take a closer look </p>
</li>
<li><p>When it reaches about 50%, the focus <strong>turns to the code</strong><br>At this time, I’m basically familiar with the author’s narrative method. Scan the title and you basically know what to do. Combine the code and guess with a guess. Just scan the text. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Know how to give up<br>Memorizing the dictionary does not allow you to speak fluent English, so there is no need to finish this book.<br>For example, when I watched it, I thought iCloud and the like were too troublesome. If you simply synchronize data, it’s better to set up a backend directly, so just skip it.<br>It’s just in line with the 28th rule. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Pairing<br>The effect of working alone is not as high as group learning<br>But what you can see is different. For example, my friends are watching the Python Cookbook. It’s enough to achieve mutual promotion.<br>PS: When I watched more than half of it, I realized that he was watching the translated version… </p>
</li>
<li><p>English<br>iOS update is too fast, the latest ones are all in English, 7 has not been translated yet, the official version of 8 will be released…<br>So, learn English well, Sao Nian </p>

    <title>Cathedral and Bazaar</title>
    <url>/the-cathedral-and-the-bazaar/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have always been weird<br>Programmers in the eyes of the general public are generally dumb, acting logically, immersed in their own world all day long, taciturn, high IQ and low EQ. There is endless debate about which programming language or framework is better than another<br>Oh, and the most important one: Muyoumei paper </p>
<p>This also confuses me, and for a while I even disagree with this label from the bottom of my heart </p>
<p>Because looking at some big cows abroad, in addition to their superb code, they also write blogs, publish books, marketing, start companies, venture capital, diving, climbing, traveling…<br>And it’s not just a taste, it can only be described as guarding the sky<br>Is this… a programmer? </p>
<p>After reading this book, I realized that the name of this race is: Hacker </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>When I watched “The Hacker and the Painter” last time, it was very cold<br>I still remember that when I first learned the C language, I told my brother that I didn’t want to be a hacker or engage in security-related stuff.<br>After all, the school’s library at the time was filled with stuff like “hacker offense and defense practice” and “hacker disassembly”. </p>
<p>After many years, I now know that what I don’t want to be is a cracker </p>
<p>For hackers, Eric gives some suggestions in the article: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to be a hacker, please read on. If you want to be a hacker, read the alt.2600 newsgroup (news:alt.2600). If you find that you are not as smart as you think, be prepared to go to jail for 5 to 10 times. This is what I want to say to hackers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding this, I have doubts. I have time in the future to see what version they were before 2000. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Java is also a good language for learning programming. It is more difficult than Python, but it can generate code faster than Python, I think it can be used as an excellent second language </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t read Python, just look at Ruby. This is a language that makes you cool. Also, due to the publication time of this book, iOS &amp; Android has not yet appeared </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is best to learn all five languages (Python, Java, C/C++, Perl, and LISP). They are not just the most important hacker languages, but also represent completely different programming methods, each of which will benefit you a lot. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reinvent the wheel </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creative minds are an extremely precious limited resource. They should not be wasted on reinventing the wheel, especially when there are so many fascinating new questions waiting there. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>GUI </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem lies mainly in ergonomic design and interface psychology. Hackers have always been weak in these areas. Hackers do a good job designing interfaces for other hackers, but they are often not good at modeling the thought process of the other 95% </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the book excerpt, the appendix is very interesting </p>

<h2 id="2-Cathedral-and-Bazaar"><a href="#2-Cathedral-and-Bazaar" class="headerlink" title="2. Cathedral and Bazaar"></a>2. Cathedral and Bazaar</h2><ol>
<li>Good software works often come from the personal needs of the developers </li>
<li>A good programmer knows what to write, a good programmer knows what to rewrite (and reuse) </li>
<li>“Plan to throw one away. Sooner or later you will do it.” (Fred Brooks, Chapter 11 of The Myth of Man-Month) </li>
<li>If you have the right attitude, interesting things will naturally find you. </li>
<li>When you are no longer interested in a program, your last responsibility is to give it to a competent successor </li>
<li>Treat your users as development collaborators. This is the most worry-free way if you want to quickly improve code quality and effectively troubleshoot errors. </li>
<li>Publish early, publish often, and listen to user feedback. </li>
<li>If there are enough beta testers and co-developers, almost all problems will appear quickly, and then naturally someone will solve it. </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Linus’s law tells the most critical difference between the cathedral mode and the market mode: in the eyes of the cathedral builders, bugs are tricky, hard to find, and hidden in the depths. It takes several months of dedication. With careful inspection, you can be confident that all errors have been eliminated. And the longer the release interval, if the long-awaited release version is not perfect, people’s disappointment becomes more inevitable. </li>
<li>For the market model, it is completely different. With thousands of co-developers eagerly studying each new release, you can assume that bugs are easy to find, or at least quickly become easy to find. So you will release frequently to get more corrections, and the side effect is benign: even if there are some minor issues in the release, you will not lose too much. </li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>Smart data structures with stupid code are far better than the other way around. </li>
<li>If you treat beta testers as your most precious resource, they will become your most precious resource </li>
<li>Next to having a good idea is to identify good ideas from users, sometimes the latter is better </li>
<li>Usually, the most breakthrough and innovative solutions come from the realization that your basic idea of the problem is wrong. </li>
<li>“Perfection in design is not that nothing can be added, but that nothing can be subtracted.” </li>
<li>Any tool should have expected functions, but a great tool can bring you unexpected functions. </li>
<li>When writing gateway software, try not to interfere with the data flow as much as possible, and never throw away the information, unless the recipient forces you to do so </li>
<li>When your language is far from Turing-complete, syntactic sugar will benefit you a lot. </li>
<li>The security of the system depends only on the secrets it possesses. Beware of false secrets. </li>
<li>To solve an interesting problem, first find a problem that interests you. </li>
<li>If the development coordinator has a good communication medium like the Internet at least, and knows how to lead without coercion, then multi-person cooperation must be better than individual combat </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you feel fear and disgust during work (even if you express it in the form of self-deprecating-such as hanging a Dilbert doll), you should realize that something went wrong with the process. Happiness, humor and playfulness are real assets </li>
<li>“Play” is the most economically effective work mode in creative activities. </li>
</ul>

<li>In gift culture, social status does not depend on what you control, but what you give </li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If it doesn’t work as I expected, it’s not good-no matter how smart and original it is. </li>
<li>Extensive work at the mental level is better than repetitive work in a functional domain (for existing works). </li>
<li>Works that can enter the main release are better than those that cannot. The works included in all major releases are the most respectable. </li>
<li>“Use” is the most true compliment, and the category killer is better than its competitors. </li>
<li>Compared with those who only pick interesting and simple tasks, those who have long been committed to hard and tedious tasks (such as debugging and writing documentation) are more admirable. </li>
<li>Important function extensions are better than low-level repairs. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4-Magic-Pot"><a href="#4-Magic-Pot" class="headerlink" title="4. Magic Pot"></a>4. Magic Pot</h2><ol>
<li>Reliability/stability/scalability is very important. </li>
<li>Except for independent peer review, there is no other convenient and easy way to verify the correctness of the design and implementation. </li>
<li>The software is very critical to the customer’s business. </li>
<li>The software creates or operates a public computing or communication infrastructure. </li>
<li>Key methods (or methods that can achieve equivalent functions) are public knowledge </li>

<p>But these things are related to the combination of left and right brain skills, which may be the key to the problem (hackers not only need to have strong logical reasoning skills, but also be able to quickly escape from the specific logic of the problem) </p>

</ul>
<h3 id="Don’t"><a href="#Don’t" class="headerlink" title="Don’t"></a>Don’t</h3><ul>
<li>Don’t use stupid, exaggerated usernames or nicknames. </li>
<li>Don’t get involved in Usenet (or anywhere else) online scolding wars. </li>
<li>Don’t call yourself “cyberpunk”, and don’t waste time interacting with people who call themselves cyberpunk. </li>
<li>Don’t let your posts or emails be full of incorrect spelling and bad grammar. </li>
</ul>
<p>At last:<br><strong>“You are a hacker only if other hackers think you are a hacker”</strong><br>The values expressed are similar to the ideals declared by the elite groups of the medieval European chivalry era (usually unachievable). These social elites have sufficient financial resources to surpass the scarce economy in which they are located. As one might expect, an aspiring knight fights for justice. He seeks honor instead of money. He stands on the side of the weak and oppressed, constantly seeking opportunities to challenge the limits of his heroic talents. It is precisely because of this that he will consider himself (and considered by others) to be a leader among people-provided that his abilities and conduct have been recognized and officially recognized by other knights. In the chivalry eulogized by Arthurian tales and chansons de geste, we see idealism, constant challenge to oneself and the pursuit of status, which are similar to the elements that motivate hackers today. </p>

    <title>Willpower</title>
    <url>/Willpower/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As modern magic spells become more and more complex, a successful project often needs to be calculated in months. Magisters who know this well are honored as the myth of man-month </p>
<p>In this environment, spiritual power is very precious and important to the wizards </p>
<p>Speaking of mental power, it’s actually pronounced as <code>WillPower</code> in the kingdom of the elves, but after being introduced into the empire, it was forced to translate as self-control or willpower by unknowing Muggles. </p>
<p>Sounds very mysterious + tall, in fact, you only need to grasp two characteristics </p>
<ol>
<li>battery </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mages use their mental power to control magical elements </li>
<li>Morning&gt; evening </li>
<li>Available sleep/meditation call back </li>
<li>Different magic consumes different power </li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Muscle </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Variable total reserves </li>
<li>Can be expanded with specific exercises </li>
</ul>

<p>Mr. Brooks bowed his head and prayed silently at the dinner party where he was awarded the Business Person of the Year; the prayer came from Niebuhr’s 1934, one of the most famous prayers of the 20th century: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>My God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(PS: Do children’s shoes sound familiar~) </p>
<p>Among the features, <strong>specific exercise methods</strong> and <strong>sleep</strong> are what we can change </p>
<p>Chip Heath/Dan Heath co-authored [Transient: How to Make Your World Better](<a href="http://book.douban.com/subject_search?search_text=%E7%9E%AC%E5%">http://book.douban.com/subject_search?search_text=%E7%9E%AC%E5%</a> Mentioned in 8F%98&amp;cat=1001) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of our daily actions are spontaneous rather than supervised. And this is a good thing, because it is difficult to supervise, it will gradually consume self-control ability. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-control ability is an exhaustible resource, which is a crucial realization. Because when we talk about “self-control”, we are not talking about the superficial meaning of the word, but it means that willpower needs to fight against vices (smoking, eating cookies, alcohol). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of this, the book gives a simple and effective exercise method:<br><strong>Internalized Habits</strong>-Set up an <strong>Action Trigger</strong>, its role is to create an “instant habit” </p>
<p>Because in such a cycle, there is no conscious and deliberate thinking, and this can also avoid the loss of people’s energy for self-control </p>
<p>The result is like a classmate driving a car. At first he was in a hurry, but later (thought) he would not drive into the ditch when he called (→_→) </p>
<p>And the aspect of sleep does not just refer to the sleep of more than six hours at night, and naps of no more than half an hour during the day can also be included.<br>The most important one is: sleep when you are sleepy<br>After all, under the condition of insufficient mental power, forcibly controlling magic elements will have the risk of bursting magic weapons </p>
<p>If you still don’t give up, please call the following formula:<br>Achievement = efficiency X time </p>
<p>PS: In case the efficiency is negative… </p>
<hr>
<p>With correct ideological guidance, and after a period of devil training, the little mage is delighted to find that his mental power has improved significantly<br>The most obvious is that when you are in good condition, you can control 15+ Pomodoro every day, and usually around 12 </p>
<p>At the same time, the little mage also discovered that his mental power reserves cannot be increased indefinitely<br>And if it is a book with a large amount of information such as “A Brief History of Information” and “Out of Control”, the power consumption will be very fast </p>
<p>So I can only devote my limited energy to more important things </p>
<p>This is also where Katsuma Kazuyo <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/3729173/">Time Investment Law</a> <strong>Time Investment Distribution Map</strong> (Four Quadrant Rule + Time Record) appeared </p>
<p>But the most paradoxical thing is that after you control what you want to do, other things are messed up. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/10786473/">self-control</a> mentioned: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>More willing to “try multiple mating strategies” after dieting </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this also one of the reasons why some stars cheat? (→_→) </p>
<p>But our little mage doesn’t even have girlfriends, so it’s not obvious<br>The side effect is that after more than a dozen Pomodoros, if you continue to read the book, the stack will be full and cannot be pushed.<br>In addition, the reaction became sluggish, and after the library closed, he looked demented on the way home. </p>
<hr>
<p>PS: Willpower is a bit like immunity, not the stronger the better. Excessive willpower = chronic stress<br>PS2: People who integrate themselves have the right willpower </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The last sentence<br>This reminds me of Zhang Xiaolong knowing <a href="http://www.zhihu.com/question/20198823">If this world is just a piece of code, what bugs have you found so far? </a> Quite humorous answer to this question </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is unrealistic to require a variable in the code to check the code for bugs. </p>

<h2 id="Book-excerpt"><a href="#Book-excerpt" class="headerlink" title="Book excerpt:"></a>Book excerpt:</h2><p>The meaning of freedom is not to do it rashly, but to “freedom of choice” </p>
<p>Both life and technology seem to be based on non-material information flow. </p>
<p>Autonomy: self-repair, self-protection, self-maintenance (access to energy, discharge of waste), self-control of goals, self-improvement </p>
<p>We should treat technical elements like nature. We cannot ask technology to obey us, just as we cannot ask life to obey us. Sometimes we should surrender to its guidance and be happy to feel its colorfulness; sometimes we should strive to transform its true colors to meet our own needs. We don’t have to implement all the requirements of the technical elements, but we can learn to use this power instead of against it </p>
<p>Language is a technique that allows thinking to question itself; it is a magic mirror that tells the brain what it is thinking; it is a joystick that transforms thoughts into tools. Language has mastered the elusive goalless movement of self-awareness and self-control, so that it can control thinking and make it the source of new ideas. Without the rational structure of language, we cannot know our spiritual activities, and naturally we cannot think about our behavior. </p>
<p>Money brings more choices, not just more material (although more material is also a result). We will not be happy because of more equipment and experience. What makes us really happy is to be able to control time and work, have the opportunity to enjoy real leisure, escape the uncertainty caused by war, poverty and corruption, and seize the opportunity to pursue individuality Freedom-all this happens with the growth of wealth. </p>
<p>Human nature is malleable. We change our values, expectations and self-perception through thinking. We have been changing our nature since the time of the apes, and once that happens, we will continue to transform ourselves deeply </p>
<p>Technology is an extension of life, and the common needs of the two are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Improve efficiency </li>
<li>Increase chance </li>
<li>Improve spontaneity </li>
<li>Increase complexity and diversity </li>
<li>Increase specialization </li>
<li>Increase universality </li>
<li>Increase freedom </li>
<li>Promote symbiosis </li>
<li>Increase beauty </li>
<li>Improve perception </li>
<li>Extended structure </li>
<li>Improve evolvability </li>
</ul>
<p>free<br>Like everything else, our free will is not unique. The choice under the subconscious free will is in the primitive behavior pattern of animals. Every animal has basic needs, and they will make choices to meet these needs. But free will even appeared before life. Some theoretical physicists-including Freeman Dyson-believe that free will emerges in atomic particles, so free choice was born in the heat of the Big Bang and has continued to expand since then. </p>
<p>Technological elements are the way the universe creates self-awareness. Carl Sagan gave an impressive explanation of this: “We are stardust thinking about the stars. </p>

    <title>Imperial Capital</title>
    <url>/BeiJing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since my reading is almost half a thousand, I have always wanted to introduce the stuff about fast reading in a few paragraphs. </p>
<p>As a result, as soon as I drag this series, there is nothing left…<br>It is estimated that the level is still limited and can not be written… </p>
<p>Let’s do something else first </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>Nasim Nicholas Taleb used the entire book “Random Wandering Fools” to explain “uncertainty”, and then used the entire book “Black Swan” to describe how to deal with the unpredictable future<br>The little mage hastily read through and thinks he has the essence </p>
<p>Between Shen Zhen and Imperial Capital, after careful consideration (tou nao yi re), I decided to choose the <code>Hard</code> mode to see if the hidden skills can be turned on get√ </p>
<h2 id="surroundings"><a href="#surroundings" class="headerlink" title="surroundings"></a>surroundings</h2><p>Most of the children’s shoes in the south have always had the impression of the imperial capital: </p>
<p>When it rains, it’s Jiangzi again: </p>
<p>After a week of fieldwork, the little mage came to a conclusion </p>
<p>“The above picture is exaggerated, but it’s really true!!!” </p>
<p>Don’t you see the air is too dry, and the girls on the road have bad skin<br>Don’t you see that the roadside cars and the ground are covered with a layer of dust because of the dust </p>
<p>Since the little mage found a girl walking barefoot on the asphalt road when it rained in heaven, he stopped wearing socks.<br>As a result, the Imperial Capital took two steps and got a pair of sandpaper… </p>
<h2 id="accent"><a href="#accent" class="headerlink" title="accent"></a>accent</h2><p>Geographically speaking, the young master was born north of the Huaihe River, and has always thought that he is a northerner, but he agrees with the southern way of life.<br>When I first arrived in heaven, I was told by the children that the sound of “er” was very heavy, and they were said to have caused them crooked </p>
<p>After I came to the imperial capital, I learned that the little witch has seen the big witch<br>Where is this official description: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mandarin</em> uses <strong>Beijing Voice</strong> as the standard tone, and northern dialect as the basic dialect… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sound of “er” here is so heavy that it sounds funny, and the little mage can’t help but laugh when he hears people talking on the way.<br>But in just two days, the little mage found out that he was taken in a ditch… </p>
<p>But there are really many crooked nuts on the road, and many of them don’t speak English (Little Master still knows a little English, it should not be an accent problem) </p>
<h2 id="intermediary"><a href="#intermediary" class="headerlink" title="intermediary"></a>intermediary</h2><p>I think that when I was still in heaven, renting a house only had to stop at the gate of the community, and immediately surrounded a group of enthusiastic aunts, and there was no intermediary fee.<br>When the imperial capital arrived for the first time, the little mage was not prepared enough, and still thought it was similar to heaven, but when he arrived at the gate of the community, he found that the little blackboard (except for a layer of dust) was clean. Asked the security at the door about the renting situation, the security shook his head repeatedly, and replied “I don’t know” </p>
<p>There used to be more than ten square meters at 0.8k in heaven, 1.3k is enough to face south + large balcony<br>And no matter how cheap the room paper is, even the basement has its own bathroom, so you can run naked after taking a shower.<br>The little mage Jiangzi still complained (with the meager salary) </p>
<p>The price of the imperial capital is x2.5, and the bathroom is shared<br>There are also houses within the third ring road, some of which are older than the time the little mage was alive.<br>The walls are yellowed with spider webs in the corners, and all kinds of mess inside the house<br>And most of the five-bedroom rooms, in case one house is crowded with young couples, there are 8 excluding the young masters, and during the WC peak in the morning… the young masters thought of using Queue to achieve FIFO </p>
<p>When I went back to the hotel to search for reliable intermediaries at night, I found that there were no corpses in the Imperial Capital. No matter how big or small, as long as they were intermediaries, they had been hacked out. </p>
<p>It’s a pity that the little mage has just arrived, and he is not familiar with the place of his life. He knows that “I am a fish and a man is a knife”, but he has no alternative. </p>
<h2 id="advice"><a href="#advice" class="headerlink" title="advice"></a>advice</h2><p>The children from the south, the muds are filled with too much chicken soup, such as: </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">趁着年轻，多去看看外面的世界</span><br><span class="line">年轻就应该有梦想，不管最后怎么样，起码尝试过，不后悔</span><br><span class="line">旅行并不是旅游，要在那里 挤公交挤地铁，上下班...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The little mage gave the muds a piece of advice with rope life: </p>
<p>Thousands of watches come here because:<br>*<em>true! of! ! meeting! ! ! dead! ! ! ! of! ! ! ! ! *</em> </p>

    <title>Why we will gradually become conservative</title>
    <url>/why-are-we-tend-to-be-conservation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At a certain stage, I always feel that my parents are old and stubborn, disgusting and unwilling to touch new things, because they are young and ignorant, I even laughed at them </p>
<p>Today, when I worked for IE8 all morning, I finally changed from Win 8.1 to Win7 (as for why, I mean two words: online banking), and I was shocked when I thought that I would never use the new system again as a last resort. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Recently, Microsoft has been forced by various browsers to start brushing the version number<br>The customer service of CITIC Bank said that IE8 is best for USB USB. I saw that Win8.1 comes with IE, and it has reached 11… </p>
<p>But IE and the system are bound, and in desperation, I can only change the system. Because it is installed in the virtual machine, all kinds of tossings, although the final is Happy Ending, but the time of the morning cannot come back </p>
<p>Recall that when the Yosemite 10.10 Dev version came out, as a developer, I didn’t have a cheap hand, so I just upgraded it until the official version was released. </p>
<p>The reason is that when I was in university, the preview version of Win7 just came out, and I couldn’t wait to upgrade it. It turned out that the broadband connection disappeared every time I restarted. </p>
<p>I also tried [Dvorak keyboard](<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E5%BE%B7%E6%B2%83%E5%A4%8F%E5%85%8B%E9%8D%">http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E5%BE%B7%E6%B2%83%E5%A4%8F%E5%85%8B%E9%8D%</a> B5%E7%9B%A4) It is not a problem to be familiar with the key position after a month<br>And I feel that the speed has indeed improved. Although there may be some psychological factors, I obviously feel that the keys in the middle row are pressed more. </p>
<p>but! When I use someone else’s computer, I completely become a fool in the eyes of others! Every time I say “I use Dvorak keyboard” with heartfelt words<br>The most deadly thing is that after using Ubuntu, the English is okay, the system is there, and the Chinese is tragic again.<br>Coupled with the popularity of Android, it’s basically impossible to have a Dvorak layout on mobile keyboards. </p>
<p>Then, I can only compromise </p>
<p>For example, at work, use Ubuntu 10.10 to compile the Android ROM. Although 11 is more beautiful, even 10.10 officially has given up support, but if you are a bit cheap, you can’t compile it at all. </p>
<p>There are countless examples of sauce </p>
<p>I think I’ve already started to be afraid of things before I’ve been established, so because older people have suffered a lot and lost more pits, so gradually they don’t want to touch new things anymore? ? </p>
<p>Reference [Learned Helplessness Experiment](<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BF%92%E5%BE%97%E6%80%A7%E5%A4%B1%E5%8A">http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BF%92%E5%BE%97%E6%80%A7%E5%A4%B1%E5%8A</a> %A9), this is again the nature of the animal, it seems there is no good way </p>
<p>But such a person will gradually become boring, like a pool of stagnant water slowly stinking </p>
<p>I don’t want to be that person </p>
<p>Look at some older and interesting people, talk to them, there is no pressure, you can better explain your ideas </p>
<p>So how do they keep up with the times and stay curious? </p>

    <title>Why study philosophy</title>
    <url>/Why-we-learn-Philosophy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Any subject has a trial range, useful or not is relative<br>If your life is relatively smooth and the surrounding environment is better, although there are boats, there is nothing to take advantage of, and although there are soldiers, there is nothing to report. I haven’t <strong>reflected</strong> on anything, it may be useless </p>
<p>But if you keep curiosity and keep seeking, whether you are in politics, research or business, you will definitely encounter philosophical problems in the end<br>Because philosophy is about the origin of the world </p>
<p>Harvard University Political Science Professor Michael J. Sandel in “Justice-What Should I Do?” “The paragraph at the end of the first lesson is very, very good (so good that people watched the full set like chasing American dramas) summary: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading philosophy books can be used as an exercise in your <strong>cognition of yourself</strong>.<br>Philosophy makes things we are familiar with become unfamiliar. It does not give us more new information, but gives us <strong>another way of looking at things</strong>. It has two levels of adventure: <strong>personal level and political level</strong>. The so-called adventure on a personal level is that once those familiar things become unfamiliar, they will never be the same again. Self-knowledge is like a lost traveler, no matter how confused or disturbed he is, you can no longer think about it. This process is difficult but you have to devote yourself to it. Moral and political philosophy is like a story. You don’t know where it will take you, but you know clearly that this is a story about you. The political risk is that after you read these books and participate in these discussions, you will become a better and more responsible citizen, you will examine those assumptions about the public political realm, and your political judgment will Get exercise, you will be able to participate in public affairs more actively, but this may be one-sided and misleading. What you need to admit is that it may make you a worse citizen instead of a good citizen, or at least it will make you a bad citizen before you become a good citizen. That’s because of philosophy, which is a long time ago, and even a little destructive. Let us take a look at a conversation in the Socratic era. Socrates’ friend Calicole hoped to persuade him to leave philosophy. He said to Socrates: Philosophy is indeed beautiful. It is only beautiful when you are moderately involved in it, but if you are too addicted to it, it will destroy you. Listen to me, put aside those philosophical debates, think about what is the real achievement in life, don’t learn from those who waste time in ambiguous philosophical statements, you should look at the rich lives of those who really live well. Reputation and other things. He meant to say, buddy, be realistic. But one thing Kohler is correct: <strong>Philosophy will alienate us from the original conventions, pre-ordered assumptions, and inherent ideas</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When facing these problems, we have a special way of avoiding it. Its name is skepticism. It means that, like this, we have just begun to learn, and there is no way to completely solve the cases or principles that we argued at once. , And if Aristotle, Kant, Locke, and Muller have not solved these problems for so many years, who do we think we are? Can you solve them after just spending a semester in the sanders hall? Moreover, this may just be a question about each person having their own different principles. There is nothing worth discussing, and it is not clear why these problems are. This is how skepticism escapes. Regarding this, I think I can answer this: Indeed, these issues have been discussed for a very, very long time, but it is precisely because they are constantly being discussed that although in a certain sense they are <strong>impossible to be explained</strong>, But on the other hand, they are also <strong>cannot be avoided</strong>. The reason is unavoidable because the answers to these questions are in our daily lives. Therefore, skepticism just lets you let go and give up thinking. It will not solve any moral or philosophical problems. Kant has a very wonderful description of skepticism. He wrote, “<strong>Scepticism is just a place for people to rest in the process of exploration. It allows us to wander in some dogmas, but it is definitely not that we can stay forever. Where *<em>.” Here, I want to briefly summarize the purpose of this course is to *</em>awaken endless curiosity and reasoning to see where it will take us</strong>. </p>

    <title>An indigestible programming language is a bad language</title>
    <url>/An-indigestible-programming-language-is-a-bad-language/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When I was Gap Year, I saw this book. I was writing questions at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a>. I only saw the Ruby chapter. At that time, I felt that Go was already very Geek. </p>
<p>One year later, when the company I am currently working for was refactoring the backend, I considered <code>Scala</code>. One of my friends saw the high salary of the game, so he resolutely went to see <code>Erlang</code>. There was a <code>Thoughtworks</code> event sharing I heard. Clojure` </p>
<p>When I read this book again, I found that <code>Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell</code> </p>
<p>I’ve been sitting in the well and looking at the sky, I read this book again and found that I don’t really need to read this book </p>
<p>So if you are curious and satisfy your curiosity, you can take a look. If you want to study seriously, skip it. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>Looking at the programming languages, there are so many people who can’t escape the following categories: </p>
<ol>
<li>model </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Functional </li>
<li>OO </li>
<li>prototype </li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Data structure algorithm </li>
<li>data structure <ul>
<li>Types of </li>
<li>Linked list </li>
<li>Hash table </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>process <ul>
<li>judgment </li>
<li>cycle </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concurrent </li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding concurrency, since the process does not conform to human thinking, there seems to be no good solution at present<br>I think that even if it is solved in the future, it should be written and encapsulated by some talented people, so that people with mediocre IQ can solve it as simple as writing <code>ifelse</code> </p>
<p>Personally, the popularity of a language is inseparable from the following points: </p>
<ol>
<li>Commercial Promotion (Java|OC) </li>
<li>Safe and stable </li>
<li>Is it easy for humans to read </li>
</ol>
<p>No need to say the first two points, if you say too much, it will be tears </p>
<p>It is mentioned in the seven languages of seven weeks:<br>In many ways, Clojure is the wise kung fu master, the oracle on the hill, or the enigmatic Jedi trainer. </p>
<p>The benefits of Lisp are known from “The Hacker and the Painter”, and Emace is known as “the editor of God” </p>
<p>However, it’s so good and so awesome, but it’s not popular, it’s a question worth pondering </p>
<p>From the perspective of syntactic sugar, I still remember that I used <code>Swift</code> once, a previous generation (C/C++/Java) programmer (non-derogatory), just saw the return value changed to -&gt;, the variable type was Exclaimed from behind<br>As for myself, I completely accept <code>Go Swift</code> and other grammatical sugars, but I also feel that <code>Lisp</code>‘s prefix expressions are all uncomfortable. The simplicity is good, and I get dizzy when it is long, and the closing brackets are very heretical.<br>It can be seen how difficult it is for programmers to accept the new syntax after getting used to a system </p>
<p>“Code is written for people to see” </p>
<p>So I think that language that is anti-human reading will disappear, or at least not become popular among humans. </p>
<p>So Mazi took another approach, focusing on how to make programmers write code happily </p>
<p>So there is no best language, only the most suitable language </p>
<p>Of course, none of the above mentioned applies to a situation where computers have evolved to be able to write code </p>
<p>Because this has broken away from the human paradigm </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>When the book was written, object-oriented was still a niche, but now functional programming has become popular </p>
<p>Today, most of the ideas and methods of refactoring are slightly heard by programmers who are a little bit pursuing. If you are a Java programmer, it is even harder not to know<br>So far, reconstruction has been similar to a part of coding </p>
<p>Chapters 1 2 3 of this book have already explained what refactoring is and when, so you should read it carefully<br>4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 are specific methods, those who are familiar with Java can take a look<br>Just skip over the following chapters </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>I once brushed <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1477390/">“Code Encyclopedia”</a> in school, so, after reading this book, <strong>relative</strong> is not that important </p>
<p>For example, although my iOS is weak, but seeing the project of the company now, I am drunk with hundreds of lines of functions, a lot of repetitive code, and various magic numbers<br>Of course, this is not to say that the previous project was not good. After all, everyone was forced to become stupid by <em>deadline</em> </p>
<p>In general, this book should be <strong>passed over</strong>, after all, the cover is printed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cheats that ordinary programmers must practice to advance to programming masters </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because if you don’t look at it, you may not be aware of the pits that people passed by. </p>
<p>Like my understanding of temporary variables is incorrect<br>There is also the previous writing of functions <strong>too random</strong>, like parameters without <code>let</code>, and without adding <code>private</code> for those that are not exposed </p>
<p>The more instructive are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate temporary variables </li>
<li>Polymorphism replaces Switch </li>
<li>Null Object </li>
</ul>
<p>At present, the time to make iOS is still short. I belong to junior programmers. There are so many things I don’t understand. Every time I do functions in trial and error, I ignore all these things when I write.<br>Although I often think about refactoring immediately after the function is OK, people are lazy, and often see that everything is fine if they can run, and then put the hope of organizing the code on refactoring </p>
<p>The ideal situation is:<br>Version control + Review + pairing + refactoring (The current company is very good, it has been implemented mostly) </p>
<p>But this reminds me of a classic paper on software engineering published by Fred Brooks in 1987-[“No Silver Bullet”](<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B2%">http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B2%</a> A1%E6%9C%89%E9%93%B6%E5%BC%B9) </p>
<p>Refactoring is certainly not a silver bullet </p>
<p>Can only rewrite the boy </p>

<p>Don’t think the first criterion is:<br><strong>Never personally work on a computer</strong> </p>

<p>As a code farmer, I can only haha </p>

<p>Something like that, the great black leader Li Zongwu has the style of “heart black as coal and face like a city wall” </p>

<p>The end of the book is about weighing family and career, just when I thought the old fritters like Wiesel would make pig’s feet give up marriage<br>I didn’t want to change the front of the conversation, and coldly threw it over:<br>*<em>Is this what you want? *</em> </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look at this book so enlightening<br>As a result, our CTO picked it up and flipped through it the other night, and said: The painting is so ugly, but I am embarrassed to say it is a design </p>
<p>awkward </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>But this reminds me of the <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/3765227/">C++ book written for everyone</a> that I read when I was in college. At the time, it felt so normal, but Douban 8+ </p>
<p>So it’s really important to meet the right book at the right time </p>
<p>It’s been a while since I jumped from <code>C</code> to <code>C++</code>, and <code>MFC</code> is also in use, so I probably don’t count as <em>everyone</em> anymore. It’s normal to have no inspiration </p>
<p>Regarding this book, I personally feel that its purpose is not to train you as a master, but to target children who have never paid attention to design or who want to get started but don’t know how to get started. </p>
<p>So the use cases inside are the comparison between <strong>no design</strong> and the addition of <strong>basic design elements</strong>, which is naturally out of the eyes of experts. </p>

    <title>What I talk about when I talk about running</title>
    <url>/What-I-talk-about-when-I-talk-about-running/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The old breath permeates the book from beginning to end<br>Regarding the passage of time and the decline of physical ability, there is no alternative </p>
<p>It is different from rashly resisting and insisting on disobeying the old. Yes, the author gradually accepted this fact and used it as a rule to deal with </p>
<p>Many questions I am curious about, the author has also reflected on and went deeper </p>
<p>This is roughly: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m the kind of person who likes to be by himself. </p>
</blockquote>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day’s work goes surprisingly smoothly. I think Ernest Hemingway did something like that. To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for longCterm projects. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m the type of person who doesn’t find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I ran a bar, so I learned the importance of being with others and the obvious point that we can’t survive on our own. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The clouds are mere guests in the sky that pass away and vanish, leaving behind the sky. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it’s precisely because people are different from others that they’re able to create their own independent selves. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I had to give it everything I had. If I failed, I could accept that. But I knew that if I did things halfheartedly and they didn’t work out, I’d always have regrets. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I only began to enjoy studying after I got through the educational system and became a soCcalled member of society. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We’d closed the club, so we also decided that from now on we’d meet with only the people we wanted to see and, as much as possible, get by not seeing those we didn’t. We felt that, for a time at least, we could allow ourselves this modest indulgence. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was my real schooling. But you can’t keep up that kind of life forever. Just as with school, you enter it, learn something, and then it’s time to leave. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m struck by how, except when you’re young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don’t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you’ll lack focus and your life will be out of balance </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, you can’t please everybody </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Life just isn’t fair, is how it used to strike me. Some people can work their butts off and never get what they’are aiming for, while others can get it without any effort at all. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It suits me. Or at least because I don’t find it all that painful. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing we ever learn at school is the fact that the most important things can’t be learned at school </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>while they’re getting by on these, they may actually discover real, hidden talent within them </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I’m wrong, but I won’t change. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My own individual, stubborn, uncooperative, often selfCcentered nature that still doubts itself—that, when troubles occur, tries to find something funny, or something nearly funny, about the situation. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This takes time, of course, but sometimes taking time is actually a shortcut. </p>

<p>The version may be older, but you can make up for it </p>
<p>The Phabricator we use here, because it is iOS, is placed on the local Mac instead of the server, so the private key is good enough, and the callback interaction between Jenkins and Phabricator is ignored. </p>
<p>In addition, there are several problems: </p>

<p>As a result, it was prompted that ResourceRules.plist could not be found the next day. It was OK to delete this in Jenkins. It’s amazing. </p>

    <title>Painless Acupuncture</title>
    <url>/Painless-Acupuncture/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Once I talked about Chinese medicine in the magic group 粢饭, and found that 80% of my colleagues thought Chinese medicine was deceptive. The little mage was shocked. </p>
<p>Later, I talked about this with a magician in Red Riding Hood. The little mage thought that healing was like marching and fighting. </p>
<p>Combat strength of both sides: I 5 enemy 8 </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Western medicine directly kills the virus, reducing the enemy’s combat power to 3<br>And the Chinese medicine is like adding a halo to increase our combat power to 10 </p>
<p>As far as the result is concerned, there are 2 after the fight, so it’s best not to believe in a certain plan. </p>
<p>As for the unbelief, on the one hand, there may be too many scammers. For example, after being deceived a few times, you will no longer believe in love.<br>On the other hand, medicine has its limitations. Today, when Western medicine is relatively perfect, cancer can still be misdiagnosed, not to mention that there are still no effective treatments for some diseases.<br>There is also a possibility that the public has a misunderstanding of the theory of Chinese medicine, just as a child who often learns magic strangely can’t even repair magic instruments. </p>
<p>In the third year of the Magic Academy, the little mage got a serious illness and didn’t want to be a blessing in disguise, so he comprehended [The Theory of Human Ecological Balance](<a href="http://leihao0.github.io/2012/05/28/%E4%BA%">http://leihao0.github.io/2012/05/28/%E4%BA%</a> BA%E4%BD%93%E7%94%9F%E6%80%81%E5%B9%B3%E8%A1%A1%E8%AE%BA/), I have not had any disease after Dache<br>Xiao Chao, who usually catches a cold, kills chickens with a sledge knife and directly sacrifices “Suwen·Four Qi Tiao Shen Dalun” by <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/3843957/">Huang Di Nei Jing</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s why the sage does not cure the disease and cures the disease, and the incurable cures the disorder but the disorder. This is also the case. It’s not too late if the husband’s disease has become a disease and then the medicine, the chaos has become, and then he can be cured. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the disease is about to start and there is a warning, calculate it to eliminate it in advance </p>
<p>But I also said before that the little mage has problems with his waist and cervical spine due to occupational problems. For example, the KW test in <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/25981248/">Magic Health Guide</a> cannot pass , The swing in yoga can’t do it </p>
<p>But the little mage is lazy, unable to keep exercising, let alone running like Chun Shang Chun Shu for decades, so he can only hope for acupuncture </p>
<hr>
<p>To be precise, acupuncture and moxibustion are divided into acupuncture and moxibustion, but people often think that acupuncture and moxibustion are all needle sticks, so let’s describe it like this </p>
<p>Descartes once divided the method of studying a problem into four steps in <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1071023/">Talk about Method</a>, the first of which is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will never accept any truth that I am not clear about, which means that we must try to avoid recklessness and prejudice, and can only be very clear and certain based on my own judgment, without any doubtful truth. That is to say, as long as you have not experienced the problems you have personally experienced, no matter what authoritative conclusion you have, you can doubt it. This is the famous “doubt everything” theory. For example, Aristotle once concluded that women have two fewer teeth than men. but it is not the truth. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I have drunk medicine, but it hasn’t improved much, so the little mage doesn’t believe in herbal medicine. </p>
<p>But meridians, to be precise, acupuncture points, are easy to feel<br>For example, Hegu (Hukou), Jianjing, pinch it by yourself, and then pinch another place, you will know that it is not ordinary meat.<br>The meridians conflict with the three chakras and seven meridians of Indian yoga, so it is the little mage who is skeptical </p>
<p>Many times before the needle, the little mage had simulated the whole process:<br>I saw that the 2.5-inch stainless steel needle penetrated the epidermis -&gt; dermis -&gt; subcutaneous tissue effortlessly. Due to the inaccurate recognition of the acupoints, unfortunately it touched the arteries and veins. The little mage’s painful hand shook and broke the next one. Autonomous motor nerve, disabled for the rest of my life… </p>
<p>Mark Twain lamented in his later years </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of my life has been worrying about things that have never happened. No behavior is more stupid than worrying out of nothing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little mage was pierced several times by a small partner of the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. After being able to bounce around without any major incidents, I guessed that the motor nerves were not like optical fibers as previously imagined. There was only one, and it was broken when it was broken. There are many roots, and the organism has the ability to repair itself </p>
<p>But the little friend lives far away and can’t come often. He keeps some hospital needles every time, so the little mage takes care of himself. </p>
<p>Of course, the act of digging the corner of socialism by small partners should be strictly prohibited. But compared to another one, I bought a super-sized power bank in order to not use my own home appliances, and charged my notebooks every time I came back, and notified the stunned people’s police of the little mage, which is nothing. </p>
<hr>
<p>But there is still a problem-the little mage is afraid of pain<br>This is also the reason why he hasn’t had a physical examination every day </p>
<p>So the little mage first moved out the <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/4665276/">True Qi Operation Method</a>, in an attempt to solve this problem once and for all by opening up the two channels of Ren and Du, and even stupidly wrote [ Log](<a href="http://leihao0.github.io/2014/01/08/%E7%9C%9F%E6%B0%94%E8%BF%90%E8%A1%8C%E6%B3%95-">http://leihao0.github.io/2014/01/08/%E7%9C%9F%E6%B0%94%E8%BF%90%E8%A1%8C%E6%B3%95-</a> %E6%89%93%E9%80%9A%E5%B0%8F%E5%91%A8%E5%A4%A9%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95/) To record the whole process, it is a pity When the Qi is stuck on the tail, you can only slow down </p>
<p>But the cervical spine cannot be slowed down. First, it has affected sleep, and secondly, I am afraid of myself. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, rule the Liufu, and then the Wuzang. Those who rule the five Tibetans are half dead and half alive. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the night of New Year’s Day, the little mage was tossing and turning on the bed, and in this moment of silence, he remembered Schopenhauer <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1004699/">the world as will and appearance</a> A few words in: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that everything that exists is just the existence of the subject. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he was reciting these few sentences, he never understood the reason. At this moment, he suddenly remembered that neck, shoulder, waist and leg diseases are different from organ diseases, which are difficult to cure. Irregular treatment or rehabilitation training will only cause illness. Repeated or even worsening pain, but according to the meaning of “The World of Will and Appearance”, it seems that the disease only exists for “I”<br>Thinking of this, the little mage quickly got up and flipped through the book, Guo Xian said again: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time the body is subjected to an external effect, this effect immediately and directly stimulates my will… and the reverse is also true. Every violent excitement of the will, that is, touch and passion, shakes the body and hinders the function of the body. run </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinking of this, the little mage suddenly realized that he sat down cross-legged and adjusted his breath according to the method shown in “True Qi Movement”<br>Then he concentrated his thoughts into a beam of light, forming a sample paper of needles, and slowly plunged into Dazhui. As expected, the surrounding muscles gradually relaxed.<br>After that, the little mage took Fengchi, Fengfu (isn’t this for treating colds?), and Gao Liao (who is seriously ill, it is really an acupuncture point)<br>After the acupuncture is finished, imagine that the light needle slowly dissipates heat ([Warm Needle Moxibustion](<a href="http://leihao0.github.io/2013/09/11/%E6%B8%A9%E9%92%88%E7%">http://leihao0.github.io/2013/09/11/%E6%B8%A9%E9%92%88%E7%</a> 81%B8/)) </p>
<p>Slowly, the little mage fell into a dream safely </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The little mage wanted to see how his Elvish language level was<br>Although before graduating from the Magic Academy, I got the CET6 certification<br>Unfortunately, this certificate cannot correspond to the true level </p>
<p>Before, the little mage had only one trick when dealing with Elvish words-recite NCE<br>This also helped the little mage successfully pass the celestial certification </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>But reading the book a hundred times is not a universal rule. The little mage can’t read each article hundreds of times, but it seems that he has never thought about it.<br>For example, in high school, under the Yali of the college entrance examination, I was fined to stand for the entire class several times for not being able to recite. </p>
<p>There is God’s will in the dark. About a year ago, the little mage accidentally obtained a book of truth-<a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/3748247/">Dialysis of Dafa</a> </p>
<p>I was deceived a lot. At first, the little mage thought it was <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1008501/">Don’t</a> this kind of pseudo-subject, and an article written by <em>Leakhouse</em> [神贴] ](<a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/11522125/">http://book.douban.com/subject/11522125/</a>), although the tips are pointed out, but no corresponding training plan is given </p>
<p>Dialysis of Dafa is as good as it can be. It can be called a model from the pit to the gods series. It not only writes out in detail that each level should practice god horses, but even possible passes are also involved. </p>
<p>Then the little mage started practicing </p>
<hr>
<p>one year later… </p>
<p>I have to say that the cultivation progress of the little mage is really slow, and the Gap Year has just passed the elementary <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/4201317/">Introductory Phonetics</a> Counting](<a href="http://book.douban.com/review/6300403/">http://book.douban.com/review/6300403/</a>)) </p>
<p>After the mid-level-ESL (slow speed), the little mage listened to the top 80 with patience and couldn’t help but jump in technology </p>
<p>As for the mid-to-high-level APW Podcast, the little mage casually watched and listened to it, even if it’s done. </p>
<p>Then brush off the next-high-level AAC and forcefully practice the highest-level SSS </p>
<p>Of course, these are destined <strong>randomly</strong>… </p>
<hr>
<p>Around the time at the Magic Academy, the little mage heard that there was a test called IELTS in the West. Judging from the results, the local elves would get good badges, and the little mage had the heart to try. </p>
<p>But when I checked the fees, I was shocked. I thought that 1% of CET’s Celestial Coins would be able to participate, which shows the weight. </p>
<p>So the little mage has made up his mind to prepare well, spend the money on the blade, don’t make unnecessary sacrifices, and don’t give away experience. </p>
<p>I don’t want inflation to be as fierce as the tiger, this fee is rising year by year, and there is a tendency to break 2 </p>
<p>A while ago, the little mage saw that his friend had signed up, and he added a sentence of “tax delay”, gritted his teeth and reported it. </p>
<hr>
<p>The test address is ideal, just next door to the current Magic Group </p>
<p>When the little mage signed up, the little abacus was very good-after the exam, you can return to the company to have a meal, which is great </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Two black spots appeared in the distant skyline. After slowly expanding, there were two people, oh, two magisters.<br>Their flying speed is extremely fast, and supporting such speed shows that the magic power of the two is high </p>

<p>Just listen to the magician α telling β that if you speed up like this, even if you catch up with the deadline, there will be little magic left. Why don’t we suppress the magic value and go to Stargate?<br>β took a look at α, continued to fly forward, for a long time, said slowly, in case of failure<br>α I can’t help but shudder, I don’t know if it’s stimulated by the high altitude too cold </p>
<p>I caught it, after β said, threw a bottle of soylent to α, and then silently drank it to supplement his magic </p>
<p>The so-called StarGate is a tool for long-distance teleportation. Although magicians can also pass and effortlessly, it is helpless that Stargates have been occupied by Muggles, and before entering, the guard will use a similar torch order. Obsidian test whether the passer is carrying a lethal weapon<br>Although 99% of the mages are kind, the magic stones they carry with them will make the holy fire scream non-stop, and the mages who reach the level of the mages are covered with magic all over their bodies. Even without any props, they will inspire obsidian<br>If you don’t evacuate in time or even make a desperate move, the state-level armed forces will appear in a few minutes, grab you and close the small black house, and since then, the world will disappear. </p>
<p>When approaching the city, they quickly lowered to below 1500 sea level, so as not to be mistaken for UFOs and shot down by the imperial capital’s missile defense system. </p>
<hr>
<p>The imperial capital is surrounded by mountains on three sides<br>The western mountains are [Taihang Mountains](<a href="https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%E5%A4%AA%E8%A1%8C%E5%B1%B1%E8%84%89&amp;hl_tag=textlink&amp;tn=">https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%E5%A4%AA%E8%A1%8C%E5%B1%B1%E8%84%89&amp;hl_tag=textlink&amp;tn=</a> SE_hldp01350_v6v6zkg6)’s northeast remnant<br>The mountains in the north and northeast are [Yanshan Mountains](<a href="https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%E7%87%95%E5%B1%B1%E5%B1%B1%E8%84%89&amp;hl_tag">https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%E7%87%95%E5%B1%B1%E5%B1%B1%E8%84%89&amp;hl_tag</a> =textlink&amp;tn=SE_hldp01350_v6v6zkg6) of the western branch.<br>The whole is a semi-basin topography </p>
<p>Seeing from a distance on each mountain top, most of the magicians are already in place<br>Near noon, the huge magic circle depicted faintly flashed </p>

<p>At that time, the sun shines like a thousand-year-old glass<br>—— Ming Ling Mengchu’s “The First Moment to Make a Case Surprise” Volume 28 </p>

<p>It’s noon, yellow sand is all over the sky, rolling in </p>
<p>At this time, on the highest mountain, the Release Grand Magister drew a series of mysterious spells in the sky<br>A shining seven-color beam of light rushed straight into the sky. After receiving the signal, the magicians on each peak pointed their wands to the sky, condensing a spell with magic power:<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a> </p>
<p>For a while, a huge transparent water-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a> slowly rose on the mountains surrounding the imperial capital.<br>The moment the force of nature came into contact with the magical summons, the surface of the lake when it rained on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">Shell</a>, ripples appeared. </p>
<p>So far, before the magicians run out of magic power </p>
<p>Under the dome, the sky is high and the clouds are pale, clear water and blue sky </p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, the level of the little mage is too low, unless you bring equipment, otherwise Stargate usually, as long as you pay the fee after the price increase, you can just pass it.<br>So those things above have nothing to do with him, and he has no idea about it </p>
<p>It’s just that the little mage feels that these days, the sky is particularly blue, and the air is filled with a lot of water vapor.<br>Looking up at the sky, the blue sky is like washing, making people intoxicated </p>

    <title>Tips for rewriting iOS apps</title>
    <url>/Little-tips-about-rewrite-an-iOS-app/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I finished my Gap year and went to my current company last fall. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>As a newcomer, I did not do much in the first month. There is a software engineer from AMAP with 10 years of experience. Every time I have something to ask him, he will explain in depth, and patiently ask him to inspire me. But at the same time, I also found thousands of lines of Copy &amp; Paste code in the project. Yes, I used <a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/">CLOC</a> to count and found that there are nearly 20,000 rows in total. </p>
<p>Since Objective-C is an overly verbose and cumbersome programming language (which means you have to write dozens of lines of code to implement the same function, and this function may only have one line in Ruby), the calculation for this project is reasonable of. But copy and paste should always be avoided. To make matters worse, I see global variables and magic numbers everywhere. </p>
<p>This is weird, isn’t it? If you are a programmer with 10 years of experience, can easily handle pointers, and have a deep understanding of computer systems, why not pay attention to the code style? After all, we need to prepare for adding new members and new features to the team at any time. </p>
<p>He said that most of the code was written by himself and that bug fixes were quick. However, he will go to a startup company of a friend next month. So, he just left, and the code of Anqu. 😭😭. </p>

    <title>Summer Ends</title>
    <url>/Summer-Ends/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=26152612">Summer Ends</a><br>This is a good piece of music, because summer is really over. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>During this year, I wrote less, read less, and felt bad. Before that, I was in my gap period, and I was productive and efficient, and my heart flowed. So I started thinking about why and tried to return. </p>
<p>Because I went to Gopher China in April and met an IT farmer. CTO, tell him, maybe I’m in a bottleneck period. </p>
<p>But now it’s September, and the summer is over. I have stayed in Beijing for at most a year, and I am still stuck in this popular state. </p>
<p>I want to figure it out </p>
<h2 id="model"><a href="#model" class="headerlink" title="model"></a>model</h2><p>First of all, the lifestyle (the contract of survival) is not like Hangzhou. When I was in Hangzhou, I could rent a unit near the company, I could walk to work, and I had my own bathroom in my room, so it bothered me. But in Beijing, if I still use the same model, I will have to live in an old unit, which is older than me! To make matters worse, I have to live with my neighbors and share everything from the bathroom to the kitchen. So you have to pray that your neighbor is good.<br>For me, as an inner person, I just want to live alone. </p>
<p>Once I adjusted the scale of this business, I immediately rented a new unit. I will move out at the end of this month, but after a year has passed, I never come back. </p>
<h2 id="English"><a href="#English" class="headerlink" title="English"></a>English</h2><p>I used to read at least 10 books every month, but for the last few months when I narrowed down to the English version, the numbers have dropped so drastically that I almost never finished reading a book in a month. </p>
<p>No book makes me feel sick, no input, no output. This is also an important reason why I no longer post blogs and the “Little Master” series. Needless to say, I force all my new blogs to be written in English. </p>
<h2 id="Procrastination"><a href="#Procrastination" class="headerlink" title="Procrastination"></a>Procrastination</h2><p>This seems to be a common problem. But after seeing too many GTDs, I found a health circle based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">polyphasic sleep</a>. I can make more than 16 <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/4198078/">pomodoroes</a> a day.<br>After returning to work in the company, I only do what I want to do. I think my efficiency is still very high. </p>
<p>Although I have outsourced the application instead of DIY, preparing for IELTS and working hard is still a big challenge for me, not only because I don’t know the start date, but also my colleagues cannot understand it. I have to write nearly 70% of the code in the main project, and even rewrite some functions. I want to find a way to manage our new team (currently I like a TL assistant). </p>
<p>So, all the apps I used have been returned, and I think it really improved my situation. </p>
<h2 id="Slack"><a href="#Slack" class="headerlink" title="Slack"></a>Slack</h2><p>Not talking about Slack, although I will write some code for our CI based on its API in the future. </p>
<p>I found some things that I ran away, but I will work harder to face it in the future. For example, I hope my colleagues will write more, read translated books, cut off and so on. </p>
<p>Therefore, I dare not hope anymore. </p>
<p>In this way, winter is here. </p>

<p>The main function I want is to build our project daily in the middle night, and +1 on the build number, then push this commit to <code>Phabricator</code>, if any of these steps is fail, it will post a notification to <code>Slack</code>. </p>
<p>But after we are try to using <code>Carthage</code> instead of <code>CocoaPod</code>, it need to <code>Carthage update</code> before building. The Jenkins can’t run commands before building. So I tried using shell directly. </p>

<p>Psychological maturity is about the ability to willingly shift perspective. </p>

<h2 id="Goal"><a href="#Goal" class="headerlink" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h2><blockquote>
<p>The step on the way to a destination that you deem valuable that is important to you. </p>
<p>So end goal can often be liberating. </p>
<p>One of the reasons is because love, and especially lust and passion wears over time. </p>
<p>They are also extremely sensitive, wise, way beyond their years, saintly, generous, benevolent </p>

<h2 id="Exercise"><a href="#Exercise" class="headerlink" title="Exercise"></a>Exercise</h2><blockquote>
<p>The wonder drug: 30 minutes of physical exercise, 4 times a week.<br>At least 15 minutes of mindful exercise 6 or 7 times a week. </p>
<p>I have so many things to do. </p>
<p>Exercise should be the last thing to go. It is an <strong>investment</strong>. </p>
<p>You may lose that 45 minutes. But you’ll gain so much more. It’s such a good investment. Your memory actually gets better when you exercise. So you’ll get more buck for the bank in terms of time you study; your <strong>creativity and concentration</strong> levels go up </p>
<p>Whether you have ADD or not, especially if you have. </p>

<h2 id="Relationship"><a href="#Relationship" class="headerlink" title="Relationship"></a>Relationship</h2><blockquote>
<p>People stay together out of a sense of duty, out of habit, because they think this is their lot in life. </p>
<p>A lack of alternative </p>
<p>“do unto others what you would unto yourself.” </p>
<p>“do not do unto yourself what you would not do unto others.” </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Love"><a href="#Love" class="headerlink" title="Love"></a>Love</h2><blockquote>
<p>“Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain.” </p>
<p>But while perfect love doesn’t exist, <strong>true love dose</strong>. True love exists between imperfect humans. </p>
<p>I will find that right person. I don’t believe that. It’s simply not true. It’s not the matter of faith. </p>
<p>So what makes relationship unique? It’s not finding that one right person. Once again it’s cultivating that one chosen relationship. It’s by virtue of working together, of being together, of spending time together, of dedicating one another. That’s how we create the one chosen relationship. That’s how we create the one chosen relationship. </p>

    <title>When a company become bigger</title>
    <url>/When-a-company-become-bigger/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doing the right thing</strong> is more important than <strong>doing the right thing</strong>. The previous sentence means that you have your own arguments and reasons. The correct ** measures your own justice, whether you can be responsible for your actions. But when you enter a big company, your manager cares about whether you can do things right. This is also the reason why startups are more powerful. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>People are born social animals. If a group has fewer than 140 people, it can manage it by itself. Because everyone knows what others are doing, it is easy to have a common view of someone, and no one can be lazy. But when the team gets bigger, fog and shadows appear. Your abilities and abilities depend to a large extent on your manager, not based on your real contributions. </p>
<p>Most companies have hundreds of employees, which is why office politics is so common in large companies. How to deal with office politics is paramount. After all, this is related to your <strong>salary and promotion</strong>. If you want to do this, the best way is to become a politician. Everyone knows what is going on, but no one points out. Just like the emperor’s new clothes, the risk is that you might lose yourself. </p>
<p>This is why a good startup company is so attractive, but one day, the company will grow bigger because of its excellence. More and more strangers join, not everyone is friendly, if you still be yourself and don’t care about politics, it may cause inappropriateness, rumors will be everywhere, and when the new year comes , You have not been promoted for no reason. </p>
<p>The neutral way is to work like a robot without sharing any emotions and feelings, which will make your colleagues feel a certain professionalism. The disadvantage is that there is no chance to be regarded as a friend, but for people who have changed companies (no longer a startup), it is easier to accept than the previous company. </p>

<p>The little mage felt the same sickness and pityed each other, and taught him all the lessons he had summed up at the time, and then his friend chased the goddess. </p>
<p>End </p>
<hr>
<p>However, Lu Yao knows horsepower, and the goddess Jiyou thought was just a friend </p>
<p>For example, 🌰: A second friend was angry and ran away from home<br>Jiyou’s gunmates couldn’t find him and couldn’t solve the physiological problems, so they went to Douban to find passers-by gunmates, and they cried, made trouble, and hanged themselves at the door of Jiyou company.<br>Of course, a more scientific explanation is to arouse the attention of friends through self-abuse<br>However, this happens to be a lose-lose option in game theory </p>
<p>When the little mage was shocked by Jiyou’s patron soy oil,<br>Of course, the little mage feels that everyone should have the opportunity to repent and rehabilitate. People who are not sages and sages can do nothing, so this time I won’t talk to Jiyou.<br>And after all, there are other solutions, such as: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.solidot.org/story?sid=44714">The man gives his girlfriend a tranquilizer so that he can continue playing the game</a><br>A man was fined 500 euros by a court in Castrop-Rauxel, Germany, because he sedated his ex-girlfriend in order to continue playing games. The judge considered this to be a “deliberate attack”… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the situation has become more serious with the drift of time. For example, during the two interstellar games, the base friend was repeatedly unplugged by his gunmate and sat on the ground crying like a shrew. </p>
<p>Then the little mage secretly talked about it with his friends </p>
<p>Jiyou heard that he was wearing a green hat, furious, picked up a kitchen knife and slashed at the gun friend, splashing blood on the low-rent housing </p>
<p>Jiyou was arrested, murdered passionately, sentenced to death with a reprieve, and ended in hatred </p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t want my friends to believe in women’s rights and don’t care much about it </p>
<p>Although it is related to his official career, the base friends are in their prime of life. They are full of energy and have nowhere to release, and they are not fully aware of the relationship between the soul and the flesh. They fall into a carnal and unable to extricate themselves, and are afraid of returning to a LOL state </p>
<p>“So, they won’t break up” the little mage commented rashly </p>

    <title>Go home for the new year</title>
    <url>/Chinese-New-Year/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the last day of 2016, most people in the Imperial Capital went home<br>The little mage boringly scans the discount website in the low-rent housing<br>Suddenly Q, who hadn’t moved for ten thousand years, suddenly broke the calm. The little mage looked at it and turned out to be a goddess<br>When he clicked on his head tremblingly, he saw four words: I am married </p>
<p>sudden </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>Going home for the New Year has become a pain for the younger generation<br>As a second element, the little mage naturally knows the <strong>family calculation problem</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your parents live for another 30 years, if you go home once a year on average for 5 days each time, minus the time for entertainment, eating, sleeping, etc., you can only stay with your parents for about 24 hours, and a total of 720 hours for 30 years , Almost a month </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, according to the “Law on Protection of Rights and Interests of the Elderly” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Family members should be concerned about the spiritual needs of the elderly, and must not ignore or neglect the elderly. Family members living separately from the elderly should visit or greet the elderly frequently </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to avoid facing prosecution, the little mage tries to meet his parents twice a year </p>
<hr>
<p>But in time, it will stagger the Spring Festival and other holidays<br>Because one holiday left a huge psychological shadow on the little mage:<br>I thought that it was the Ching Ming Festival in 2013. When the little mage asked the goddess to go to West Lake to play, he was shocked by the crowd when he went to Sudi after passing the music courtyard and wind lotus.<br>At that time, the little mage was standing at the entrance of Sudi, but he could only see the people on both sides and could not appreciate the slightest view of the beauty of West Lake. The little mage did not consider that the main reason was that he threw the pot anger on holidays because of his shortness </p>
<p>The Spring Festival is the first-class citizen in all festivals. Due to the traditions of the previous generation, it was asked by the seven aunts and eight aunts about the salary and the target to ask about a good opportunity to have children<br>And now that the next generation has appeared in this world, red envelopes are naturally indispensable. While the meager year-end bonus is given away, the face also has to smile: “Ah, this child is so beautiful.”<br>What’s even more exaggerated is that Guo Jia has now fully opened up the second child, and time comes Double is ready </p>
<hr>
<p>During the Spring Festival last year, the little wizards used [Thirty-Six Strategies of War](<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%81%E5%85%AD%E8%">https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%81%E5%85%AD%E8%</a> AE%A1) in the chain meter (25)<br>As a magician, he naturally knows how to buy a ticket, so he concealed himself (1), and deliberately delayed for five minutes before going to wait for work (4)<br>Later, he informed his parents that “the ticket is not available”, and then tried to get in (16), saying that even if the ticket is 8x, he must go home<br>Naturally, the little mage’s Baba Ma Ma was shocked by this bitter trick (24), and immediately said that you don’t need to come back… </p>
<p>With last year’s precedent, it’s much easier to replicate last year’s success this year </p>
<p>Until he saw a poster that exposed the truth: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Going home during the New Year is the winner of life </p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Soylent</title>
    <url>/Soylent/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ever since the little mage bought a bottle of Soylent at a high price from a high-level magician, he has liked this stuff. </p>
<p>When the little mage was still in heaven, he used to go to the West Lake District Library<br>At that time, there was a fire in July, and as a Guo Jia building, it naturally had an industrial-grade cooling device </p>
<p>Ever since it became a holy place for the little mage, I often sit for a day </p>
<p>In the past, the magic weapon energy of the little mage lasted at most 1 hour<br>Later, I bought a <code>R, 13-inch, Mid 2013</code> and it was no problem for a few hours. Later, I just read the book or sister paper. </p>
<p>But there are so many people in the library, and the citizens of heaven are so diligent. Whether on weekends or even on weekdays, the door opens at 8:30, and there is no place for the little mage after 9:00. </p>
<p>So how to recharge oneself has become a top priority. If you quit eating at noon and then you come back, you will be a duo and you will feel like grabbing a seat in the Magic Academy. </p>
<p>So if you had this stuff at that time, just buy a 1L cup, bring 750ml of powder, plus the pure water provided by the library, you can sit in the wasteland. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>The little mage once calculated a time account: </p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// [准备, 做饭, 吃饭, 洗碗]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> 标准耗时 = [<span class="number">10</span>, <span class="number">30</span>, <span class="number">15</span>, <span class="number">10.0</span>]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> 系数 = [<span class="number">0.5</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">0.7</span>]</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> 一天总耗时 = 标准耗时.<span class="built_in">reduce</span>(<span class="number">0</span>) &#123; $<span class="number">0</span> + $<span class="number">1</span> &#125; * 系数.<span class="built_in">reduce</span>(<span class="number">0</span>) &#123; $<span class="number">0</span> + $<span class="number">1</span> &#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It’s almost three hours a day </p>
<p>So little wizards often imagine that one day when the wizards charge their magical instruments, they can charge them together with themselves due to physical contact.<br>For example, the transport aircraft in SC2 is a chestnut, and it is still remote<br>Sometimes I feel aggrieved. The price of Embody is actually not enough to carry the bio-charge function. </p>
<p>And the feed solves these time-consuming steps very well<br>Especially after the version is upgraded to 2.0, you don’t even need to shake the cup<br>In addition, the old version 1.5 is discounted to 54$, plus 100 ￥ for shipping, even if the exchange rate soars, each meal will be more than 20 oceans. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no perfect thing in the world. Everything is good and there must be disadvantages. To be a man, we must learn to weigh the pros and cons and make rational choices —— People’s Daily Online </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, feed has three big mountains </p>
<ol>
<li>taste </li>
<li>Nickel and mercury exceeded Canadian standards </li>
<li>Increase blood sugar </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The ability to solve problems is usually the product of careful and systematic thinking, and any talented person can acquire this ability<br>–McKinsey Thinking </p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>The celestial dynasty is often famous for its delicacies<br>But after the eighteen years of Ma Ma’s cooking training, the little mage didn’t want to eat rice. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Imperial Capital </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The last one is more difficult to handle, there is a feeling of fullness, but there is no chewing feeling<br>In addition, as a fluid type food, it can only stay for ten minutes, while food usually takes several hours.<br>In short, there is only transformation, no elimination </p>
<p>So the little mage has breakfast latte eggs, lunch cooking oil, dinner feed </p>
<p>Converted to a stable input box per month </p>
<hr>
<p>This time I didn’t go home during the Chinese New Year, the little mage was afraid that the supermarket would close, so he reserved a box in advance.<br>When he pinched his nose and poured it hard for half a cup, he looked at his weak chicken and felt that he should add some real meat<br>It’s not worth buying to open the frequently brushed horse<br>When I checked out, I suddenly found four big characters next to it: For Dogs </p>

    <url>/High-Templar/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the year of Little Mage Gap, he experienced various fusion blows<br>However, the most annoying one is technology selection </p>
<p>As early as in the Academy of Magic (2011), the little wizard wanted to learn iOS. After looking at it, he asked for money and turned to Android. </p>
<p>At that time, the little mage still used the plague to die. I just learned that there is another operating system called Linux. The portable tool Nokia occupies a large area. Naturally, there is no concept of . I only know that Jobs on the news died of cancer, which is a change. Who lost the world<br>After I saw one of the three major lectures <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish</a>, it was already two years later. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: The other two are [The Fringe Benefits of Failure, and the Importance of Imagination] by JK Rowling in Harvard (<a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/06/text-of-jk-">http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/06/text-of-jk-</a> rowling-speech/), Randy Pausch’s <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/videos/">Last Lecture</a> in CMU are all thought-provoking and good videos that are worth pondering </p>

<hr>
<p>After watching several classes on Android, it was 886, and there was no special reason, but the interest of playing C was not triggered in the process. </p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the school recruits, due to the remoteness and not many companies, the preaching is basically at the University of Science and Technology and the Joint University. The young master has a degree of 233, so he naturally suffers discrimination.<br>After dozens of miserable defeats, I was finally moved to heaven. A NASDAQ gave an offer, which is affiliated to the pre-research department. The location is still a dream paradise.<br>The little mage had no tears and immediately signed a contract </p>
<p>HR MM said that the company is undergoing transformation, from C fart to Android<br>Ever since, the little mage who is afraid of entering and leaving the job, in his senior year, once again bit the bullet to learn Android </p>
<p>The twisted melon is not sweet, history repeats itself, and 886 </p>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>pre-research department</strong> originally imagined by the little mage was a place similar to the academy described in “The Beauty of Programming”<br>However… Most of the time, the Philosopher’s Stone (Jar) is made from Java and incorporated into the source element. After that, the little mage summons a modified Android with Ubontu, and then burns it to each place by the live siege lion. High-level simulation </p>
<p>Having said so much, it can be summarized in two practical words: shanzhai </p>
<p>And a simple effect of Android requires a lot of Java, plus Java’s own characteristics remain unchanged, leading to the birth of various shooting modes, and the little mage is exhausted. </p>
<p>So looking back now, I don’t know if it’s Shanzhai or Java. It’s really bad.<br>Until now, the little mage still has all kinds of dissatisfaction with the spells that this mage world uses most frequently all the year round (* ￣︿￣) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: Lambda and functional are provided in 8, which looks much more concise </p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than half a year later, the little mage accidentally discovered <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">the python class of the gully</a>. For the little mage who only had contact with the CC ass shell Java, It’s a cardiotonic shot </p>
<hr>
<p>During the Gap Year, the little mage found a better ruby. After finishing the question on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, he just felt that it was inconvenient to watch the sunburst on the phone, and the official statement was not As a PC terminal, I want to make one myself </p>
<p>However, the appearance of 🐶🐺 disrupted the little mage’s plan </p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: Ruby is a weakly-typed dynamic language, that is, different types can be assigned, and they can change themselves at runtime, so there is often a line of code that does hundreds of lines of things for others<br>Yukihiro Matsumoto also mentioned in “Program World” that the primary goal of Ruby design is: cool </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the trouble is that in order to ensure correctness, we must constantly use tests to constrain<br>The result is that the longer and longer the test is, the more it will be written<br>Generally small and beautiful, but not suitable for large-scale collaboration<br>Strongly typed static languages can detect many errors at compile time </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Golang itself is strongly typed, but provides some convenient syntactic sugar<br>The most shocking thing is that when there was a lot of demand, the author first wrote formatter<br>This is one of my favorite features, it saves much time for code formatting.<br>Speaking of the first Gopher🇨🇳, the author also came to Shanghai and talked about the realization of this Dongdong </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Even though ruby has all the benefits, after the little mage has tested the two spells 🍐, he embraced 🐶🐺 </p>
<p>At this time, most of the planned gap time has passed<br>If the sauce goes down, the little mage may have gone to the full stack of siege lions<br>However, a decisive event occurred before, switching the branch lit by the magic stack </p>
<p>For some unknown reason, the little mage after choosing 🐶🐺, without any income, actually upgraded his magical equipment, replacing his father’s plague with his own rMBP </p>
<p>After completing the Demo-level website, the little mage bought a certificate and was surprised by Xcode when he came up. Σ( ° △ °|||)︴, I thought of binding the button to respond to events on Android back then, and got a bunch of code, which I used in Xcode Ctrl + drag line is done in this elegant way </p>
<p>Later, in the process of Master Stanford White Beard’s <a href="http://cs193p.stanford.edu/">cs193p</a>, <em>Head First iPhone Development</em>, <em>iOS 7 Programming Cookbook</em>,<br>The word “artwork” often comes to mind </p>
<p>After that, everything went smoothly </p>
<hr>
<p>Full stack out of Archon since ancient times </p>
<p>The little mage avoids this way, how many have his own little abacus<br>The main reason is that the full stack is too tiring, in a sense, it is all dry<br>And this also means that leisure time is infinitely compressed </p>
<p>The smaller the ability, the smaller the responsibility<br>In the final analysis, Little Master is just a good kid who likes to read in his free time. </p>
<hr>
<p>But he is too naive </p>
<p>On the way to the advanced temple mage, &gt;&gt; these pits </p>
<h3 id="WWDC"><a href="#WWDC" class="headerlink" title="WWDC"></a>WWDC</h3><p>100+/year, the little mage’s feet are shaking when downloading<br>However, in Stockholm, I will clap my hands excitedly when I see Cool’s technology. </p>
<h3 id="Adapted-version"><a href="#Adapted-version" class="headerlink" title="Adapted version"></a>Adapted version</h3><p>Little Mage has been tortured by different Android screens, stupidly thinking that the iPhone is only one screen size<br>After a year… </p>
<h3 id="Swift-pains"><a href="#Swift-pains" class="headerlink" title="Swift pains"></a>Swift pains</h3><p>Various bugs, including the built-in system… </p>
<hr>
<p>The most tragic thing is that the little mage found another sinkhole </p>
<h3 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h3><p>In the past, the little mage was blind, like fungus listening to IE 800, and did not distinguish between color difference pixels<br>Gradually improved after entering the pit, but the understanding of Design is still in the category of Shooting Lion </p>
<p>As a result, Frederick Brooks, the author of “The Myth of Human Moon”, published the book <em>The Design of Design</em> and patted it on the face of the little mage, and the author of another <em>Designing Design</em> with a similar name was known for his indifference to his mother 🐔 Advisory Committee member Japan Print Design Master Kenya Hara </p>
<p>At this point, there are three more branches on the little mage’s technology tree </p>
<ul>
<li>Sketch </li>
<li>photography </li>
<li>Keynote </li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, these are what the little mage longs for<br>After all, what made the little mage determined to enter the pit was that the feeling of “art” could be realized on a cold machine. </p>
<p>This is crying, isn’t it? </p>

    <title>Observer</title>
    <url>/Observer/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It seems that my observer is back. </p>
<p>When I finished reading <em>Being Friendly with Time</em>, I began to know the mental model, and it took me a month to finish reading that simple book. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>When I am grateful that my mental model has improved, “Power Now”. The Spiritual Enlightenment Guide declares that the mind is a trap. The predictive ability of the mind only focuses on the future. It prevents you from knowing the power of the present. These different arguments puzzled me at the time. As I continued reading, the concept of observer appeared in my eyes. </p>
<p>The first time I heard that the observer was in my university. I read this word from <em>dark forest</em>. After I read a book on quantum mechanics, it fascinated me even more. </p>
<p>There is also a concept of observer in psychology. Not only is it different from the above idea (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics)">Observer (Quantum Physics)</a>, it is also different from the <em>Design Pattern ([Observer Mode](https ://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern))</em>. When I finished <em>Think on These Things</em> a year later, I tried to build an observer about myself.<br>Because usually, when you see others doing, things will be clearer. Weaknesses and blind spots are obvious, and you will find better solutions. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I achieved this goal during the gap period. There are two versions of me, one acting and one observer.<br>I don’t think the observer is equal to the superego, but it is clearly the guardian of the ego. </p>
<p>But when I came to work in Beijing a year and a half ago, all the works I built were ruined. My observer is gone. I have some new bed habits, such as watching my watch frequently, which exposed my anxiety and tension. </p>
<p>When I do something wrong, I feel exhausted. Fortunately, I had a long vacation and I went to my parents’ house. Although that city is not an outfield, it at least got me out of the super city. In addition, I had a deep discussion with my parents about dreams. They feel very helpless because our family is poor and the hotel prices are constantly rising. They don’t understand why I behaved so strangely. </p>
<p>After 10 days, my vacation expired and I felt very relaxed. </p>

<p>Due to the large number of people,  will randomly select some lucky (reimbursed by the company) or unlucky (own expense) leeks to give 10,000 tickets 🎫<br>Afterwards, whether to go or not, deduct the money first<br>No matter if the U.S. visa is refused or denied entry, the money will not be refunded<br>Tickets are also forbidden to transfer and can only be sent to other developer accounts of the same company<br>In short, don’t even think about refunding the lottery, so think about it clearly </p>
<p>But fortunately, it was never his turn for this kind of thing, so I signed up without thinking. </p>
<h2 id="Winning"><a href="#Winning" class="headerlink" title="Winning"></a>Winning</h2><p>The draw result will be announced before the end of March </p>
<p>Suddenly received a deduction text message of $1599 from China Merchants Bank at night and a stolen card call<br>To prove to the bank that he is himself<br>Wake up at noon the next day to receive a confirmation email<br>I hurriedly called my friends and were told to prepare visas and hotels </p>
<p> is to provide some hotels near the venue, but the price of goose is very , the cheapest is also $229 per night<br>Thinking of the principle of being close alone, I can only bite the bullet and make an appointment </p>
<p>Fortunately, a colleague said that although the lottery was not drawn, he still wanted to see<br>In addition, he has two friends who can fly from Canada 🇨🇦 and 🇺🇸 Central America to San Francisco to play </p>
<p>So I quit the hotel and booked an Airbnb that looked good </p>
<p>And my friend can drive, book a Herz </p>
<p>Simply perfect </p>

<p>Then make an appointment on <a href="https://www.ustraveldocs.com/cn_zh/index.html">official website</a><br>Pay online and make an appointment for the interview </p>
<p>It turns out that applying by myself is faster than Taobao agent<br>Jump to China CITIC Bank from the payment page<br>The page is ancient at first glance and thought it was a phishing website… </p>
<h2 id="Face-to-face"><a href="#Face-to-face" class="headerlink" title="Face to face"></a>Face to face</h2><p>The imperial capital’s U.S. Embassy in Beijing is in Sanyuanqiao, Chaoyang District </p>
<p>Ask for leave in the afternoon of the interview<br>After arriving at the embassy, I was dumbfounded. I had only seen such a long team during the Spring Festival before.<br>The people waiting for the interview have twists and turns, and there are 10,000 Z-shaped dragons lined up with 18 bends on the mountain road<br>Creeping for 3 hours before seeing the interview window </p>
<p>There are a total of 5-6 interview windows in Chinese, and 1 in a deserted English window </p>
<p>My friend suddenly said that he can speak English anyway, go to the English window, no need to wait<br>Think about it, decided to give it a try </p>
<p>The interviewer is a grandmother, and I can’t remember exactly what he said at the time, roughly: </p>
<p>…<br>小： invite us to join their conference<br>The old grandma said in surprise<br>Are you working for Apple?<br>(Thinking about it: emmm, 2019 is really, but unfortunately the timeline is only 2016, so I have to say)<br>小：No, it’s a developer conference.<br>老：Why they invite you?<br>… </p>
<p>Open the folder and take out the Invitation Letter of ,<br>The old grandma pointed to the Chinese window next to him and asked them to go to the Chinese window on the side </p>
<p>The security lady who was keeping order next to them saw that they were kicked off and asked what happened.<br>Hearing this, I sighed, but fortunately, I didn’t directly refuse, so I asked them to wait for a while beside her. </p>
<p>Then the Chinese interview was a foreign lady<br>She was also confused. Conference<br>It is guessed that people in non-IT circles don’t know what Conference is<br>So she took out the invitation letter, Miss Sister said she didn’t want to read it, and continued to ask him to explain why </p>
<p>The little mage was stunned. If it was probably because of the language before, why didn’t I read the material this time<br>Because other people have a lot of interview experience, I only heard that those who did not bring the documents were rejected, and they didn’t read the documents if they hadn’t heard.<br>Fortunately, my friend said it was Developer Meeting, my sister understood it in seconds (😓…) </p>
<p>Then I asked if the U.S. Emperor had any relatives, how long he was there, when he would come back, and where to live. </p>
<p>Waited for a long half minute<br>Miss sister smiled and said congratulations, the visa passed<br>You will receive your passport by mail in about a few working days </p>
<p>Twists and turns, not particularly happy<br>I thanked him and went back with my friends </p>
<p>Later, a long-lived in Boston heard that there was a Chinese interview<br>You can also meet with two people<br>You can also drag the family to the noodles together<br>My jaw dropped </p>
<p>U.S. visa<br>Already fallen<br>He said </p>

<p>The customs asked a few common questions, such as why are you here, stay a few days<br>According to the visa situation, it’s not called Conference, but Developer Meeting<br>Then the customs stamped it </p>
<p>After I got my passport back, I immediately appeared calm and calm, but in fact I speeded up my pace and went inside<br>For fear of being shot </p>
<p>After seeing some people who picked up the airport, I remembered that the little friend hadn’t come<br>After waiting for a long time and thinking that my little friend GG, I saw him<br>It turned out that Conference was checked for a while </p>

<p>🏠 It’s exactly the same as what Airbnb saw, no fraud<br>It’s just that the House has two floors, like a wooden structure, and there is another tenant upstairs, so there will be noise when running.<br>There is a garden behind, very nice </p>

<p>The most well-known section of Lombard Street is the “Jiuquhua Street” on the Russian hills. Jiuquhua Street is the section between Hyde Street and Leeviworth Street. This is because it is the most curved street in the United States. There are a total of eight sharp bends in a short stretch of road, and only one-way traffic from Hyde Street to Leeviworth Street and downhill is allowed, while the San Francisco cable car runs on China Street. -The Hyde Street Line passes through the starting point of this section (that is, the location of the highest point at the intersection). This section of the very steep street was originally a straight line, but considering the safety of traffic and pedestrians, this section of the road was changed to the current curve in 1923. [2] This design was first proposed by the owner Carl Henry. [3] This design aims to use length in exchange for space to slow down the slope size (27%) along the line. [4] The entire Jiuquhua Street is 600 feet (180 meters) long, and the straight section is 412.5 feet (125.7 meters) long, and the pavement is paved with bricks to increase friction. The starting point is marked with a maximum speed limit of 5 mph (8 km/h). </p>

<p>The name and neighborhood features of San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf come from the mid to late 19th century, when Italian immigrant fishermen took advantage of the influx of people brought by the gold rush to the early days of the city. Most Italian immigrant fishermen settled in the North Beach area near the pier and fished for local delicacies and Danji crabs. From then until today, the dock is still the center of the San Francisco fishing fleet. Although the area was re-developed as a tourist attraction in the 1970s and 1980s, there are still many active fishermen and their fleets. </p>

<p>Any exposed part of the body–including earlobes, scalp, and lips–can be burned. Even covered areas can be burned, for example, if your clothes have loose weaves that allow ultraviolet (UV) light to pass through. Your eyes are extremely sensitive to ultraviolet rays from the sun and may be burned </p>
<p>When UV photons hit the skin, they damage the DNA in human cells. It does so by breaking the ordered bonds between the four nucleotides of adenosine, thymine and guanine. The so-called formation of thymine dimers means that when two thymine nucleotides are combined together, the shape of the entire DNA molecule becomes imbalanced.<br>Cells with messy DNA usually commit suicide, a process called apoptosis. The cells have received so much radiation that they undergo apoptosis. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I haven’t written anything for a long time. Perhaps writing entirely in English is an obstacle. </p>
<p>Too much happened in these two months. </p>
<p>First of all, the D-round financing of my company failed. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Our CTO had to reduce the number of programmers designing apartments by more than one-third, reducing three applications to one. Almost half of the programmers left. It seems that everything is back to the B round happy time.<br>However, some things can never go back. </p>
<p>My project iterated to version 1.6 and was cut off. So, no coding job, after that, I went to San Francisco to participate in WWDC16. </p>
<p>Second, do what you like. </p>
<p>Therefore, programming is my job, and it is my gap year after the iOS developer. </p>
<p>When I first started working, I subscribed to many technology blogs, but they never caught my attention. At the same time, I lost interest in everything and didn’t want to see anyone. </p>
<p>It may be caused by my lack of real hobbies. My only hobby was programming. </p>
<p>However, after going to Beijing, the most breathtaking super city in the world, two years ago, I finally had a little extravagant time to relax my body and spirit. </p>
<p>Third, after returning from SFO, I did readjust the importance of exercise. In developed countries, almost every elite will exercise. </p>
<p>When I saw the blue sky everywhere, the wide Pacific Ocean, the green leaves under the sun, and the houses on the mountains covered by mist.<br>I know there is a wonderful world in the world.<br>Maintaining your own heat is the most important, and everything else is secondary. </p>

<p>All payment steps are only number, date, resume, password. </p>
<p>After repeating it again and again, I collapsed. </p>
<p>It should be automatic. </p>
<p>For the sake of god, when I was still using Windows four years ago, I thought of AutoHotkey. </p>
<p>Mac has AppleScript, which can simulate keyboard input and mouse clicks. </p>

<p>And I discovered an interesting thing in the process, that is, <strong>cvv</strong> cannot be clicked by the script. </p>
<p>It seems that the bank’s website has really done some work in terms of security. </p>

    <title>Sync macOS ssh config with iCloud</title>
    <url>/Sync-macOS-ssh-config-with-iCloud/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As a developer, I sometimes have to restore the backup due to the “beta” system. </p>
<p>Fortunately, most of the data is on the server these days. Not only Safari, photos, calendar, Note, reminders, but other applications also use iCloud storage. This is a major advancement. I just need to reinstall the system and re-download the app from the App Store and <code>brew shell</code>. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>So I created a new folder named “macOS” in the iCloud Drive folder, and copied all the files without “. “, for example: <code>.gitconfig</code> ~&gt; <code>gitconfig</code>. </p>

    <title>How to add Xib on StoryBoard</title>
    <url>/How-to-add-Xib-on-StoryBoard/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In 1975, the classic software project management book “Mythical Man Month. In Essays on Software Engineering, Fred Brooks pointed out that no matter which programming language is chosen, a professional developer writes an average of 10 lines of code (LoC) per day. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>StoryBoard is conducive to saving lines of code and improving efficiency. Apple will strongly recommend it at every WWDC and continue to improve it. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I don’t understand why there are still many team leaders who ask their poor programmers to write UIView programmatically. </p>
<p>Maybe they think that some CustomViews are very reusable, and if they are pasted into StoryBoard, they will cause unnecessary side effects. </p>
<p>Therefore, the main idea of this solution is to condense CustomViews into Xib and then add it to StoryBoard. </p>
<p>This requires several steps, because Apple does not directly support it. </p>
<ol>
<li>Add an IBDesignable <code>CustomView.Swift</code> and <code>CustomView.Xib</code> </li>
<li>Set <code>CustomView.xib-&gt;Placeholder-&gt;File Owner-&gt;Custom Class</code> to <code>CustomView</code> </li>
<li>Create a new CustomView programmatically and load the root view from CustomView.Xib </li>
<li>Add a root view with equal width and height in the horizontal and vertical centers on the <code>CustomView</code> of the init function </li>
<li>Now you can drag View to StoryBoard and set its class to <code>CustomView</code>, which can generate a snapshot for preview </li>
</ol>
<p>But the subviews of CustomView (such as UIButton) cannot be connected to ViewController<code>@IBOutlet</code> </p>
<p><code>Delegate</code> or <code>Block</code> can solve this problem. </p>
<p>As for me, I suggest the <code>Block</code> method, because I have used <code>Delegate</code> for half a year and found </p>
<ul>
<li>ViewController will have too many delegates </li>
<li><code>delegate = self</code> must write <code>viewDidLoad</code> and sometimes <code>=nil</code> in <code>viewDidDisappear</code> </li>
</ul>
<p>The code for <code>Block</code> will be less and simpler. </p>
<p>Below is the <a href="https://github.com/leihao0/DesignableView">example</a>, which may reduce your time. </p>

    <title>How do Chinese learn English</title>
    <url>/How-to-learn-English-as-a-Chinese/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Like 99% of Chinese students, I hate to memorize words in cruel ways. When we were young, we naturally learned our mother tongue without any pain. </p>
<p>So, when I was in a poor elementary school, I never remembered a word. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Actually, the fact is that I cannot remember words. Believe it or not, no matter how hard I try, I just can’t remember. Every time it’s my turn to write on the blackboard in this row, I have to look carefully left and right, copying word by word. </p>
<p>As a teenager at the time, I was curious, why could they do it? The method must be incompatible with my brain. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I saw another method in a grid book where a former champion announced that she didn’t memorize words. All she did was repeat NCE aloud more than 100 times. </p>
<p>Humph, it’s really good, so I tried it. This method helped me a lot because it allowed me to get a pretty good score in the college entrance examination, and I passed CET6 in college, even I sometimes know it. What are you reading. </p>
<p>Before IELTS, all early English tests were just a joke. </p>
<p>And there is another blind spot that I only realized recently. Exams are exams. You should master the key points and leave as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Before that, I firmly believed that as long as my true level was improved, I would be able to do the exam just like doing test papers every day, without extra effort. </p>
<p>But in fact, this requires a very high quality of people, far exceeding the requirements of the examination, this is an endless road. </p>
<p>14 years have passed since I first came into contact with English. After communicating with the dormitory a few months ago, I feel that I have only taken a small step. </p>
<p>Now I know that language is more like a human instinct. When the baby grows up, our brain neurons will be washed, because according to evolutionary psychology, our ancestors did not need to learn another language when they were young. </p>
<p>But we are now in a modern society. As far as I know, there are only two methods that sound reasonable, and more importantly, economics. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18868451?from_search=true">Use your English</a> </li>
<li>Lai Shixiong American Phonetic Mark </li>
<li>ESLPOD </li>
<li>American accent training </li>
<li>Read at least 10 original books every year </li>
<li><a href="http://www.geekonomics10000.com/870">A little pragmatic learning English experience</a> </li>
<li>Learn 600 GRE words every day </li>
<li>Repeat according to the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. </li>
<li>Intensive reading </li>
<li>Past papers </li>
</ol>
<p>Now you see, the irony is that Article 2 kicked me to the point: I want to remember words! </p>
<p>But this time at least one thing is different. I chose it according to my free will. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The most popular way is <code>UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning</code> </p>

<p>In order to do this, you must: </p>

<li>Create a new subclass, which can be called “XXXTransitioning”, inherited from “NSObject”, and implement the two functions of the protocol “UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning”. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Then: <ol>
<li>Create a new instance of “XXXTransitioning” in “ViewController”. </li>
<li>Set <code>transitioningDelegate = self</code>. </li>
<li>Use UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate to extend “ViewController” and implement it. </li>
</ol>

    <title>Software accelerates your learning</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Podcasts and videos are a typical online learning method, but they are numerous, and collection is human nature, and how to increase this speed becomes even more necessary. </p>
<p>Normally, people can process their native language at high speed.<br>As for me, 2x is very comfortable, 3x is acceptable, and 4x has subtitles. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="Desktop-computer"><a href="#Desktop-computer" class="headerlink" title="Desktop computer"></a>Desktop computer</h2><p>A few years ago, when I was still in college, I used Windows. KMPlayer is the best of all types of video players, because other players may have sound distortion when they are replaced. Later, the author left the company and re-written a new one in <code>C++</code> and renamed it <a href="https://potplayer.daum.net/">PotPlayer</a> </p>
<p>On macOS, Movist is my first choice. It is also from South Korea. Needless to say, its splendor and simplicity, it provides 4 times the audio tracks without much loss.<br>Other players such as <a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV</a>, although provide unlimited rate limit (yes, you can accelerate to any speed you like) and open source, but if you want to change the default settings, every Modify <code>~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf</code> every time. </p>
<h2 id="Mobile-version"><a href="#Mobile-version" class="headerlink" title="Mobile version"></a>Mobile version</h2><p>The good news is that Podcasts on the iPhone already have twice the function (the strange thing is that iTunes Podcasts do not), and many learning apps also have this useful function. </p>
<p>But I haven’t found any application that provides more than 2 times the functionality. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avplayer#//apple_ref/occ/instp/AVPlayer/rate"></a> </p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> player = <span class="type">AVAudioPlayer</span>()</span><br><span class="line">player.prepareToPlay()</span><br><span class="line">player.enableRate = <span class="literal">true</span></span><br><span class="line">player.rate = <span class="number">2.0</span></span><br><span class="line">player.play()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If the audio is a file-based media, it seems that it can be done just by changing <code>player.rate = 3.0</code>. Will this cause distortion? </p>
<p>If one day I have time, I will try. </p>

<p>Because the fare for ANA’s activities is only twice as expensive, it’s quite a bargain. </p>
<p>Provide hot towels on board, follow-up champagne and various beverages<br>Lunch can be reserved in advance for Japanese or Western food<br>The tableware was replaced with heavy porcelain plates and metal knives and forks 🍴 </p>

<p>The roar of the engine is also much smaller, the default headset 🎧 is Bose QC 25 </p>

<p>The basic process is<br>Get on the plane for a meal and drink<br>See your name<br>Lie down and sleep<br>almost there </p>

<p>Yoyogi Park is located at this location. On December 19, 1910, Captain Tokugawa Yoshitoshi made the first successful powered airplane flight in Japan. The area later became a parade ground. Beginning in September 1945, this site has housed a military barracks called “Washington Heights” for American officers during the Allied occupation of Japan<br>In 2014, Tokyo experienced the worst dengue outbreak in 100 years, and it was the first recorded case in 70 years, with nearly 200 confirmed cases. </p>

<h2 id="Tokyo-Sky-Tree"><a href="#Tokyo-Sky-Tree" class="headerlink" title="Tokyo Sky Tree"></a>Tokyo Sky Tree</h2><p>It turns out that this tower is not only built for Gaohe scenic spots, but also a radio station. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tower is the main TV and broadcast station in the Kanto region; the older Tokyo Tower is surrounded by high-rise buildings, so it can no longer provide complete digital terrestrial TV broadcast coverage. The Skytree building was completed on Day, February 29, 2012<br>Tokyo Skytree is also similar to Japan’s historic 5-story pagoda. [11] The bottom of the tower has a structure similar to a tripod; starting from a height of about 350 m (1,150 ft) or more, the structure of the tower is cylindrical, allowing panoramic views of the river and the city. [12] There is an observatory that can accommodate 2,000 people at 350 m (1,150 ft) and an observatory that can accommodate 900 people at 450 m (1,480 ft). [13] The upper observatory has a spiral glass-covered skywalk, and visitors can ascend to the highest point of the upper platform at the last 5 meters. A part of the glass floor allows visitors to directly view the street below.<br>The tower is earthquake-proof and includes a central shaft made of reinforced concrete. The main internal pillar is connected to the first external tower structure 125 meters (410 feet) above the ground. From there up to 375 meters (1,230 feet), the pillars are fixed to the tower by shock absorbers, which act as cushions during the earthquake. Additional elasticity is obtained through “additional quality control mechanisms” (or tuned mass dampers)-a damping system that, in the event of an earthquake, will be out of sync with the structure of the building to keep the center of gravity as close to the tower as possible bottom of. [15] According to the designer, the damper can absorb 50% of the energy in an earthquake </p>

<p>A large number of unearthed cities are preserved under the ashes, providing a unique microcosm of Roman life, frozen at the moment it was buried, and providing an unusually detailed insight into the daily lives of its residents, despite many evidences Lost in early excavations. This is a wealthy city with many exquisite public buildings and luxurious private residences. Its luxurious decorations, furniture and artworks are the main attraction of early excavators. Organic remains, including wooden objects and human bodies, are buried in the ashes, leaving voids after decay. Archaeologists have discovered that these voids can be used as molds to make plasters of unique and often scary figures in the last moments of life model. There are a large number of graffiti carved on the walls and in the room, providing a large number of examples, illustrating that the colloquial Latin, which was basically lost at the time, is in sharp contrast with the formal language of classical writers.<br>Pompeii is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular tourist attractions in Italy. Approximately 2.5 million tourists visit each year. </p>

<p>At about 1 pm, Mount Vesuvius erupted violently, spewing high-altitude volcanic columns, and ash and pumice began to fall, covering the entire area. During this period, some rescue and escape incidents occurred. At night or early the next day, igneous rock flows began to appear near the volcano. The light seen on the mountain was interpreted as a fire. People in Misenum fled for their lives. Volcanic gravel flows are fast moving, dense, and high in temperature, completely or partially destroying all structures on the path, burning or suffocating the remaining population, and changing the landscape, including the coastline. At the same time, there was a slight earthquake and a slight tsunami in the Gulf of Naples. By the evening of the next day, the volcanic eruption had ended, leaving only mist in the atmosphere, and the sun was shining faintly.<br>The young Pliny wrote a record about the eruption of a volcano.<br>Wide flames illuminate many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness are more vivid than night…The rest of the world is now day, but the darkness there is darker and thicker than any night. </p>

This theater can hold approximately 5,000 spectators and is one of the first permanent stone theaters in Rome.<br>Theaters have been used in modern times to hold concerts, operas and plays. In 2008, restoration work began to enable further theater and music performances. After the reopening, Puccini’s “Bohemia” and Bizet’s “Carmen” were staged in 2014. </p>

<p>The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oprontis, Stabia, and several other settlements. The final heat release was Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 100,000 times the heat energy released by the atomic bomb explosion.<br>Mount Vesuvius has erupted many times since then, and it is the only volcano on the European continent that has erupted in the past 100 years. Today, Mount Vesuvius is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, because there are 3 million people living near it in a place that can be affected by the volcanic eruption, and 600,000 of them are in the danger zone, making it the most populous in the world. Dense volcanic area, and it is also prone to violent and explosive eruptions like Prinia. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mount Vesuvius was formed by the collision of two plates, the African plate and the Eurasian plate. The former dived under the latter, deep into the ground. When the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to the warmer depths of the Earth’s interior, the water boiled, lowering the melting point of the upper mantle, enough to partially melt the rock. Since the density of magma is less than the surrounding solid rock, it is pushed up. A weak spot on the surface of the earth was found, and the magma broke through, forming a volcano. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 5, 1995, the area around Vesuvius was officially declared a national park. The summit of Vesuvius is open to visitors, and there is a small network of roads around the volcano, which is maintained by the park authorities on weekends. You can enter by road within 200 meters (660 feet) from the top of the mountain (measured vertically), but you can only enter on foot afterwards. There is a spiral passage around the volcano from the road to the crater. </p>

<p>When light enters the cave through the water, the red reflection is filtered out, and only blue light enters the cave. The objects placed in the water in the grotto are famous for their silver appearance. This is caused by tiny bubbles, which cover the outside of the object when they are placed underwater. These bubbles cause light to refract in a different way than the surrounding water, creating a silver effect. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of the reason is that the light from the hole on the water has a dazzling effect, and the water in the hole is more abundant than the light in the air. Visitors put their hands in the water and can see the water “glow” strangely under this light. </p>

<p>I heard of artificial intelligence a year ago, but as an old man who has difficulty accepting new things, he has not really studied it.<br>But I seem to lose my job in this generation of AI🤖️ revolution. Therefore, I will study it hard.<br>However, I am too old to learn, and I have no confidence that I can master it one day. </p>

<figure class="highlight matlab"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">theta = theta - alpha/m*(X' * ((X * theta) - y))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It took me several hours to figure out why I use <code>X' * ((X * theta)-y))</code><br>Because all variables X, theta, and y, each is a vector, X’*(…) is equal to the <code>sum()</code> part, as shown in the formula. </p>
<p>Although I passed the test, I still don’t understand 😵 </p>

<p>the key points here are: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>for</code> is needed here to loop from <code>1</code> to <code>num_labels</code> </li>
<li><code>all_theta</code> should assigned with <code>(i,:)</code>, otherwise it will be a one-dimensional vector. </li>
</ul>

<p>the <code>max</code> function will return a two-dimensional vector, <code>m</code> is the value, and <code>p</code> is the max index in that row. </p>

<p>Before this, I wondering what is the process of prediction with a trained model. Is it the same with the training process? </p>

<p>Amazing ha! 🤩 </p>
<p>First I forgot to <code>sigmoid</code> the hidden layer and output layer. The Accuracy shows </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Training Set Accuracy: 69.62 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it will get the same accuracy if the output layer has no <code>sigmoid</code> . It also happened in the previous <strong>One-vs-all Prediction</strong>. </p>
<p>Therefore I still have the question. 🧐 </p>
<p>It’s time to keep on the training part. 💪 </p>

<p>I wrote the Gaussian kernel function so that sigma can be passed as a vector to get an analog vector, so <code>g = gaussianKernel(x1, x2, s)</code> is a vector, and you can skip the extra calculations in the <code>for c = l</code> loop <code>for s = l</code>. So if <code>svmTrain</code> can be calculated as a vector, <code>for c = l</code> can also be skipped. </p>
<p>But it cannot. 😢 </p>
<p>Is it related to functional programming? </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the worst task I have ever done. </p>
<p><code>TxHandler.java</code> cannot be built and run, everything is a guess. Since I am not familiar with <code>JAVA</code>, I encountered millions of syntax errors after submitting. </p>
<p>I have to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Import packages manually </li>
<li>Add “;” after each line. </li>
<li><code>()</code> after <code>if</code>. </li>
<li>Declare variable type </li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I hate JAVA 😡😡😡 </p>

<p>sequence </p>
<p>Little Master’s eldest sister suddenly said to go to Hakone </p>
<p>So skip some (many) chapters and write this first </p>
<p>As for why it became traditional<br>Because the eldest sister is Taiwanese<br>Although she can understand simplified characters </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>It happened in 8102 3🈷️ </p>
<p>At that time, the little mage had served in the former company for 3.5 years, and then went to the fruit company to sweep the floor 🧹, and his birthday 🎂 was on the same day as the pit<br>I plan to give myself a run similar to graduation 🎓 travel before that </p>
<p>After all, it’s very troublesome to change jobs, and being an inferior person will definitely be humiliated.<br>So I plan to prepare both mentally and physically in advance </p>
<p>At that time, the little mage was still young and was still in the stage of wanting to go out to play. The way to relax is that the world is so big I want to see<br>So looking at the world map, I feel like I want to go everywhere </p>
<p>But because it’s Solo, I just got my driver’s license and I didn’t dare to drive before the internship period.<br>Naturally, Europe and the United States can’t think about it, but choose the urban landscape<br>Let’s take a look at the 3-year return visa that I finally got, so I can only go to 🇯🇵 </p>
<hr>
<p>In view of the fact that the last time the little mage found in Kinosaki that the fake hot spring was boiler water, and the real hot spring ♨️ can heal a disease, he would never forget to go 🇯🇵 soak once </p>
<p>So the route is all the way north </p>
<p>Hakone-Kamakura Enoshima-Yokohama-Tokyo </p>

<p>Although I have been to Tokyo, because the first time I was following others, the little mage had a poor memory, and it was only 6 days short, so I had no impression.<br>So exactly as expected, when I came to Tokyo again, apart from knowing Skytree, it seemed like I had never been to other places. </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Odakyu"><a href="#Odakyu" class="headerlink" title="Odakyu"></a>Odakyu</h2><p>This time it’s JAL, landing at Narita Airport 🛬️<br>Originally, the young master planned to go to Shinjuku and transfer to the Odakyu Romantic Express (it is said that it is not romantic) and go directly to Hakone<br>After all, it’s only 4 o’clock, and the last Odakyu train is 6 o’clock. Even if you go from Narita to Shinjuku, it’s completely too late.<br>However hungry for Japan 🇯🇵 time is an hour earlier, the little mage is dumbfounded after the airport time synchronization </p>
<p>In a panic, the enthusiastic old man in front helped buy a ticket for the Narita Express to Shinagawa to Shinkansen 🚄 under the condition of language barrier. 🎫 </p>
<p>Catch the Guangming, which resembles the train man, is very stable and comfortable. You can see the location on the Map and jump forward quickly.<br>At Odawara (Odawara), the sun has already set, there is no bus, only the mountain train </p>
<p>After leaving the station, I was confused and didn’t know where to go. Many people walked towards me, only to see a beautiful little sister. I quickly went up and asked where the little train was.<br>After the little sister gave the way gently, the little mage walked a long way and looked back and saw the little sister nodding to indicate that he had found the right carriage. </p>
<p>After going up the mountain, it gradually rained and the temperature dropped sharply. The little mage found that the seat was getting hot, and heating was blowing up.<br>Really humane </p>
<p>After arriving at Kowakidani, the watermelon 🍉 card balance is insufficient to leave the station<br>There is no one around, just when the little mage wants to turn over and will be caught<br>An Officer appeared from nowhere, gave him a piece of paper, opened the subway door, and disappeared </p>
<p>I saw a hill when I went out of the station, and after repeatedly consulting the map, I still couldn’t believe that the vertical ladder hidden in the shadow was the road shown on the map. </p>
<p>Fortunately, after climbing the stairs, I arrived on a normal national road<br>Only 1.3km uphill </p>
<p>The little mage is holding an umbrella and dragging his luggage, walking alone on the road<br>Passing by a big 7-11<br>Still not alone </p>
<p>… </p>
<h2 id="Tenyu"><a href="#Tenyu" class="headerlink" title="Tenyu"></a>Tenyu</h2><p>When the two characters Tianyou appeared in the rainy night, the little mage had no energy </p>
<p>I thought I could enjoy the hot spring<br>I was hungry for a long time and couldn’t find the hotel entrance<br>Had to call the hotel </p>
<p>At that time, the little mage’s English was still very poor, and coupled with the other party’s Japanese English, he couldn’t understand what was being said at all, so he could only say it by himself. </p>
<p>Then I was told not to move and I would send a car to pick him up<br>After waiting for a while, there was no movement, so I had to continue walking up the mountain road.<br>During that time, a car came down from the mountain and experienced no one. The first thought of the little mage was, there is a car on the mountain? ! </p>
<p>Give way to the bottom and continue to go up </p>
<p>After walking for a while, the little mage suddenly opened his mouth, it wouldn’t be the car just now. </p>
<p>Go back quickly </p>
<p>Back to the bus stop just now, I found that the car really stopped there<br>After showing the Booking Detail with the driver, he picked up the Master </p>
<p>In the meantime, I asked the driver if there was any Shuttle at Xiaotianyuan Station.<br>The answer is too far no<br>I don’t understand how to find this station<br>There are just a few bus stops nearby, found by name </p>
<p>The most let the little mage vomit blood is that the car returned on the same route as it just came back. It only went 500m further, and a U-turn arrived at the hotel entrance… </p>
<p>It’s not that the little mage is blind, it’s really too dark and it’s raining to see the road. </p>
<p>So if you go to Hakone from Narita Airport, don’t miss Odakyu </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Hakone-0"><a href="#Hakone-0" class="headerlink" title="Hakone 0"></a>Hakone 0</h1><p>Just choose this hotel, I have been there a few times, and it is considered very good in Hakone<br>Little Mage’s friend said </p>
<p>After looking at the price, the little mage couldn’t help asking </p>
<p>‘I’ll go alone, why do I stay in such a good hotel?’<br>Because a good hotel will be built on the hot spring ♨️ the spring eye, the next time you need to draw water, the temperature is not guaranteed </p>
<p>‘Go alone, why do you want to stay in such a good hotel’<br>This hotel can choose a room with a hot spring on the balcony, instead of going to the male and female baths, it is very private </p>
<p>‘I am going by myself’<br>After working continuously for so long, let’s relax and take a graduation trip. 🎓 ✈️ Well </p>
<p>Then the little mage couldn’t help the temptation and ordered Hakone Kowakien Tenyu<br>Listening to the name makes me feel at ease </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<h2 id="Tenyu"><a href="#Tenyu" class="headerlink" title="Tenyu"></a>Tenyu</h2><p>After the little wizard was pulled to the hotel by the shuttle, the luggage was wet because of rain<br>The little sister of the receptionist took out a brand new towel to wipe the luggage 🧳 and helped deliver it to the room </p>
<p>The little mage felt it was unnecessary in his heart, and after climbing the mountain road for a long time, he had no energy to speak, he could only sigh the service was so good </p>
<p>As Hao said, the hot spring is on the balcony<br>There is a small button next to it. Just press the hot spring that smells of sulfur and it will pop up.<br>Go to the vending machine to buy a lot of energy drinks to prevent dehydration, and then start to cook the meat </p>
<p>There was light rain and fog outside the balcony, and the curtains were rustling with the mountain breeze. </p>
<p>The little mage stayed in the hot spring watching the rising heat until late at night, listening to the sound of wind and rain outside, feeling that everything was worth it </p>
<hr>
<p>Wake up the next day, the fog has not cleared </p>

<p>The little mage is very shy and doesn’t like meeting people<br>I planned to lie down on the balcony for two days </p>
<p>However, hungry and hungry, he went to the male soup on the top floor<br>I was stunned in an instant </p>
<p>Although iPhone X 📱 is waterproof<br>Although there was only one person in the pool, when the little mage came, he left </p>
<p>But this kind of candid place can only steal official pictures </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21020.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Wow, it feels like the infinity pool of Marina Bay Sands in Po County<br>It’s just that the swimming pool has been replaced with a hot spring </p>
<p>Then the little mage looked at the mountains in the distance, thinking that there was a female soup next door<br>Go downstairs and find that the female soup is actually downstairs, and men and women will change it every day<br>I don’t know if it’s ☯️ there is a good balance between yin and yang </p>
<p>So it shouldn’t be like the top floor, you can only see the mountains from the house </p>
<p>That’s boring, the little mage plans not to leave the room the next day </p>
<p>The fact is<br>The fifth floor is a small pond with fallen leaves 🍂<br>There is a waterfall flowing down from the hill more than ten meters away<br>This waterfall is a hot spring </p>
<p>Helpless, the official did not give the picture<br>It’s a big surprise </p>
<p>Breakfast is also great<br>You can choose Japanese or Western style<br>To the window, outside is a bamboo forest </p>

<h2 id="little-Prince"><a href="#little-Prince" class="headerlink" title="little Prince"></a>little Prince</h2><p>It will be cooked after all<br>Little Mage had to go out and stroll around </p>
<p>I was surprised to find that there is a little prince’s temple (museum) next to it </p>
<p>PS: The first love of the little mage loves the little prince </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21000.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As early as January 3102, the little mage had studied the little prince<br>The timeline of this series also happens later<br>So the name was more or less inspired </p>

<p>My rose, others think she is like you, but she alone is better than all of you. Because she was watered by me. Because I put her in the flower cover. Because she was protected by a screen. Because I got rid of the caterpillars on her. Because I have heard her complaints, her bragging, and sometimes her silence. Because she is my rose. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you love a flower blooming in the vast sea of stars, then when you look up at the stars, you will feel satisfied </p>

<hr>
<p>So hungry, first love made the little mage wait for three years at the Magic Academy<br>And finally got together and dumped him in a week<br>So the little mage hates the house and Wu doesn’t like the little prince<br>I don’t understand why I am so respected all over the world </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21003.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After a round, I went out to the Crystal Museum </p>
<h2 id="Hakone-Glass-Forest-Museum"><a href="#Hakone-Glass-Forest-Museum" class="headerlink" title="Hakone Glass Forest Museum"></a>Hakone Glass Forest Museum</h2><p>It is said that it should be like this: </p>

<p>What the little mage saw was this: </p>

<p>Only here is like a fairy tale<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21004.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21003.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The little mage rushed over and saw: </p>
<p>Closed up tea room<br>Bare moss garden<br>The rose garden is not romantic at all 🌹🌹🌹 </p>
<div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21011.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21023.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21009.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div>

<p>So recently, the little mage has been pestering her big sister to teach her how to make a picture like the one in the brochure<br>🐶🐶🐶 </p>
<hr>
<p>Even so, the little mage still saw the moss bamboo forest towering trees and white clouds </p>
<div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21008.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21006.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21010.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div>

<p>The same scenery is like this in the writings of the ancients in the pre-Qin Dynasty </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bai Hua Jian Xi, Bai Mao Shu Xi. My son is far away, leaving me alone!<br>Yingying Baiyun, showing off Swarovski. The day is difficult, the son is not jealous!<br>——“Xiaoya Baihua” </p>

<hr>
<p>The seasons are not right, there are gains and losses </p>
<p>Let’s go back and cook the meat<br>Little mage comforted himself </p>
<p>Then a German 🇩🇪 sister paper forcibly Amway a drink🥤 </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21005.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then buy an extra can and take it back as a gift 🎁 </p>

<p>Little mage saw a good thing </p>

<p>I quickly photographed it and sent it to mom and dad 👨👩 ask if you want to buy two sets<br>If you have Parkinson’s for dinner, you won’t be afraid of falling </p>

<h2 id="Bus"><a href="#Bus" class="headerlink" title="Bus"></a>Bus</h2><p>Google Map, which has always been easy to use, sucks in Hakone </p>
<p>The bus here 🚌 is very fascinating<br>I haven’t encountered any problems in larger cities before </p>
<p>However, if you are hungry, let’s not say that Japan is traveling on the left. The map is easy to read.<br>The most vomiting blood is that the bus stop sign does not indicate the starting station-the terminal station<br>There are no cars on the mountain road, so it’s hard to tell the direction<br>There are few passers-by, and those who meet don’t speak English </p>
<p>Every time I walk to the bus stop, I don’t know if I should chase the car when I see it has arrived.<br>And always ask the driver if he did the right thing </p>
<h2 id="Owakudani"><a href="#Owakudani" class="headerlink" title="Owakudani"></a>Owakudani</h2><p>They hate you </p>
<p>Make a cable car in Gora 🚠 </p>
<p>Suddenly saw Mount Fuji 🗻 </p>
<p>Although in the cable car, the elegant arc is still amazing </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21101.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I just finished Andrew Ng’s machine learning on Coursera two months ago<br>Turn over the previous <a href="https://leihao0.github.io/Logistic-Regression/">notes 📒</a><br>Recall the Gaussian distribution equation </p>
<p>$$g(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi }}^{-\frac{1}{2}( \frac{(x-\mu )}{\sigma} )^{2}}$$</p>
<p>Since Mount Fuji 🗻 is not a two-dimensional element, it cannot be used directly. You need to deform the formula and delete $\mu$ </p>
<p>$$z=\frac{20}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi }}^{-\frac{R^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}} }, \sigma= 2, R = \sqrt{ x^{2} + y^{2}}$$</p>

<p>Of course the height and slope are wrong<br>You can use linear regression to try it out. Naturally, you don’t want a human tone.<br>Of course 🗻 the top is concave, and a smile curve needs to be superimposed </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>Just then the cable car 🚠 passed the highest point </p>
<p>The mountain breeze blew over, 🚠 began to shake violently<br>The mountain below ⛰ is still smoking<br>Although it is very tall, you can still smell the pungent sulfur </p>

<p>No wonder there are hot springs here ♨️ </p>
<p>Get out of the car, there is an egg bigger than a human 🥚<br>You can see Mount Fuji in the back 🗻, it looks like the cloud just now </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan-2113.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The girl from Germany 🇩🇪 told the little mage that she must buy eggs to eat🥚 </p>
<p>The little mage is unclear. So, are foreign eggs 🥚 better than mainland gardens? </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan-2112.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Okay, the eggs here are black 🌚🌚🌚 </p>
<p>I ate five at once, and it didn’t feel strange </p>
<p>In the meantime, a European and American girl asked the little mage how to crack the eggshell<br>Helpless don’t know how to knock<br>Pointed at the door </p>
<p>Sister paper surprised<br>‘Against the door???’ </p>
<p>Oh, I used Against </p>
<h2 id="Hakone-Ashinoko-Narukawa-Art-Museum"><a href="#Hakone-Ashinoko-Narukawa-Art-Museum" class="headerlink" title="Hakone Ashinoko Narukawa Art Museum"></a>Hakone Ashinoko Narukawa Art Museum</h2><p>Then 🚠 after getting off, board the boat from Togendai Port, and the Hakone Pirate Boat makes a circle around Lake Ashi and disembarks at Motohakone Port </p>
<p>Remember to buy first class before boarding, otherwise you may not have a ticket and you can’t make up for it.<br>I’ll be disturbed by the mountain wind outside </p>
<p>But because I did something similar in Osaka before, there is not much newness<br>I saw a sculpture in the art gallery </p>
<p>So subtle<br>The material turned out to be ivory </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan21102.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is even more amazing<br>Here is a flower<br>So this is the name of Wan<strong>hua</strong> tube but its origin? </p>

<hr>
<p>Generally speaking, travel notes only mention the good side<br>It’s as if these people have airborne to the attraction without luggage or equipment </p>
<p>Little Mage is no exception<br>Because luggage can be checked in the hot spring ♨️ hotel<br>Just add the address and the luggage 🧳 will automatically pass </p>
<p>It sounds so good that when you take the small train north,<br>Once suspected to reach Fujisawa Station (Fujisawa Station)<br>Luggage 🧳 will stay in Hakone forever </p>

<p>At that time the little mage was still in the second year of middle school<br>See the majestic Buddha<br>What, the Great Burning Prajna, the Golden Wheel of Compassion, Tianyin Temple, a brain popped out </p>
<p>However, I guess Huigen hasn’t opened yet, and he didn’t hear the sound of heaven floating in the distance. </p>

<p>You will be disillusioned after detouring behind the Buddha<br>what is this? The tail interface of Gundam </p>
<p>Just when I was about to turn around, I suddenly found a small door on the right side with the words <strong>Entrance</strong> </p>

<p>Okay reveal the age<br>Little mage never saw a slam dunk when he was a kid<br>So I don’t know what’s going on with those standing on the rails 🛤️ just 🚃 frontally </p>
<p>I heard it’s burning, similar to my hero academia?<br>Because there is no resonance, I took a picture from a distance and went to the beach in front to soak up the sun and hike to Enoshima. </p>

<p>Suddenly saw a huge building<br>Although Little Mage is not as obsessed as Sheldon<br>But it’s still fun to see all kinds of small trains inside </p>
<p>For example, I saw the Hakone number that went up the mountain before<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/Japan23101.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Really worthy of being the 21st Century Port of Mirae<br>You know it started construction in the 90s<br>Landmark Tower was already there in 1993 </p>
<p>Whether it’s the siren of the seaside pier ⛵️<br>Still clean sea<br>And modern cities<br>Makes the little mage think it’s awesome, awesome, awesome </p>

<p>After a nap, I woke up in the evening 🌆, I went to the mall for a stroll </p>

<p>Titanic, volcano 🌋, temple 🛕 </p>
<p>But it was raining<br>Although the staff is still enthusiastic to create an atmosphere<br>But can’t stand the swish weather<br>Refreshing </p>
<p>Plus no express ticket<br>Popcorn 🍿️ It takes an hour to line up<br>Other projects like bumper boats for two hours </p>
<p>Hurried around<br>Came out </p>
<p>Very poor experience<br>Far, far, far less fun than the Universal Studio in Osaka last time </p>
<p>I thought Disney could play for a day<br>The result came out at 10 o’clock<br>Too embarrassing, I can only just walk around </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicas_of_the_Statue_of_Liberty">Replica of the Statue of Liberty</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To commemorate the “Japanese French Year”, from April 1998 to May 1999, the French Statue of Liberty from Cygnes Island came to Odaiba, Tokyo. [3] Due to its popularity, a replica of the French Statue of Liberty was erected in the same place in 2000. Also in Japan, a small Statue of Liberty is in the Amerika-mura (American Village) shopping district in Osaka, Japan. Another replica is in Oirase[71] near Shimoda Town in the southern part of Misawa City, Aomori Prefecture, a US Air Force base with 8,000 people. A replica of the Statue of Liberty in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, was damaged by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. [72] There is also a replica in Oyabe City, Toyama Prefecture. [73] </p>

<h3 id="Red-giant"><a href="#Red-giant" class="headerlink" title="Red giant"></a>Red giant</h3><p>Combining the huge diamond just now 💎 will involve a question of whether you should buy a diamond ring<br>well known </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three known allotropes of carbon: diamond, graphite, and fullerene. In terms of thermodynamics, diamond is less stable than graphite, and ** can spontaneously transform into graphite**, but the speed of this transformation under normal temperature and pressure is very slow and can be ignored, so diamond 💎 can exist stably. Diamonds formed in nature are generally formed in the high temperature and high pressure environment inside the earth, and later brought to the surface by geological tectonic movements such as volcanic eruptions. Therefore, many diamonds are found near volcanoes. Modern industry can produce diamond under high temperature and high pressure, called synthetic diamond </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the diamond ring has no other use other than the 🦚 function of blinding others’ eyes<br>Not to mention the magnifying glass on the sun 🌞 🔍 will evaporate </p>
<p>And heavy metals such as gold and platinum </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The atomic number of gold is higher among the naturally occurring elements in the universe. It is believed that this heavy element was produced during the supernova nucleosynthesis when two neutron stars collided, [4] existed in the dust before the formation of the solar system. Since the earth was still in a molten state when it was formed, almost all the gold of the early earth has sunk into the core. Therefore, most of the gold in the earth’s crust and mantle is due to the later heavy bombing period (about 4 billion years ago) of the asteroid impact.<br>Gold was a popular precious metal before it was recorded in history. It was used in currency, value preservation, jewelry and art. In the past, a gold-based gold standard currency system was generally implemented at home and abroad, but gold coins ceased to circulate in the 1930s. In the 1970s, with the end of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the worldwide gold standard finally gave way to the legal tender system. However, because of its rarity, easy smelting, processing and coinage, unique color, corrosion resistance, and resistance to other substances, the value of gold does not decrease. </p>

<h3 id="Gravitational-waves"><a href="#Gravitational-waves" class="headerlink" title="Gravitational waves"></a>Gravitational waves</h3><blockquote>
<p>Gravitational-wave observatory (English: Gravitational-wave observatory) is a device used to detect gravitational waves in gravitational wave astronomy. Gravitational waves are ripples caused by accelerating mass in space and time. Albert Einstein first proposed the concept of gravitational waves in 1916. [1] By detecting gravitational waves, general relativity can be experimentally verified. Commonly used detectors include rod detectors and laser interferometers. The main operating principle of these detectors is to measure the influence of gravitational waves on the distance between two distant locations. Since the 1960s, multiple gravitational wave detectors have been built and activated one after another, and there have been continuous improvements in detector sensitivity </p>

    <title>How to schedule iMessages on Mac</title>
    <url>/How-to-schedule-iMessages-on-Mac/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>First open <code>Terminal</code> on the Mac, then follow the steps below to copy and paste the following command line: </p>
<h2 id="Send-iMessage-by-Shell"><a href="#Send-iMessage-by-Shell" class="headerlink" title="Send iMessage by Shell"></a>Send iMessage by <code>Shell</code></h2><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">file=<span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$HOME</span>/Documents/sendiMessage.sh&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">str=<span class="string">&#x27;tell application &quot;Messages&quot; to send &quot;TEXT&quot; to buddy &quot;NAME&quot;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">&quot;#!/bin/zsh \nosascript -e &#x27;<span class="variable">$str</span>&#x27;&quot;</span> &gt; <span class="variable">$file</span></span><br><span class="line">open <span class="variable">$file</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You will see a file opened by the default text editing application, which shows: </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">#/bin/zsh</span></span><br><span class="line">osascript -e <span class="string">&#x27;tell application &quot;Messages&quot; to send &quot;TEXT&quot; to buddy &quot;NAME&quot;&#x27;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<a id="more"></a>

<p>Please note that you should replace <code>TEXT</code> with the text to be sent in the <code>Contacts</code> application and replace <code>NAME</code> with the name.<br>Don’t forget to <strong>save</strong> the file. </p>
<h2 id="Crontab-on-mac"><a href="#Crontab-on-mac" class="headerlink" title="Crontab on mac"></a><code>Crontab</code> on mac</h2><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo touch /etc/crontab</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You should run this line above because <code>com.vix.cron</code> will check if <code>/etc/crontab</code> exists on macOS.<br>Enter the Mac password. </p>
<h2 id="Schedule-the-shell-with-Crontab"><a href="#Schedule-the-shell-with-Crontab" class="headerlink" title="Schedule the shell with Crontab"></a>Schedule the shell with <code>Crontab</code></h2><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">00 10 25 3 * zsh ~/Documents/sendiMessage.sh</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>As the <a href="http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference">Crontab – Quick Reference</a> shows: </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">00    10    *   *    *        command to be executed</span><br><span class="line">- ---- </span><br><span class="line">|     |     |   |    |</span><br><span class="line">|     |     |   |    +----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday&#x3D;0)</span><br><span class="line">|     |     |   +------- month (1 - 12)</span><br><span class="line">|     |     +--------- day of        month (1 - 31)</span><br><span class="line">|     +----------- hour (0 - 23)</span><br><span class="line">+------------- min (0 - 59)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This shell means that your Mac will send iMessage at 10:00 on March 25th. </p>
<p>Then modify it to your ideal time. </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">crontab -e</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In the next steps, you are using <code>vim</code>, which I think is the hardest part. </p>
<ol>
<li>Press <code>i</code> and you will see <code>--INSERT--</code> in the lower left corner of <code>Terminal</code>. </li>
<li>Paste <code>00 10 25 3 * zsh ~/Documents/sendiMessage.sh</code> </li>
<li>Press <code>shift + :</code> and enter <code>wq</code>, <code>enter</code> </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Check-Crontab"><a href="#Check-Crontab" class="headerlink" title="Check Crontab"></a>Check <code>Crontab</code></h2><p><code>crontab -l</code> </p>
<p>You can see <code>00 10 25 3 * zsh ~/Documents/sendiMessage.sh</code> if everything is correct. </p>

<p>Assume we have a Json structure: </p>

<p>Please note that <code>func responseA</code> is a static type and only applies to spatial APIs that respond to the JSON you pasted. Therefore, we need generic types for all APIs. </p>
<p>So we can delete <code>func responseA</code> and define a protocol <code>MYRequest</code> as follows: </p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">protocol</span> <span class="title">MYRequest</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> router: <span class="type">String</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">get</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> api: <span class="type">String</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">get</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">associatedtype</span> <span class="type">T</span>: <span class="type">Decodable</span> <span class="comment">// generics type</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="title">MYRequest</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> api: <span class="type">String</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;v1&quot;</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> domain: <span class="type">String</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;https://domain.com&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// T is used in DataResponse&lt;T&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">request</span><span class="params">(completionHandler: @escaping <span class="params">(DataResponse&lt;T&gt;)</span></span></span> -&gt; <span class="type">Void</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">let</span> url = <span class="string">&quot;\(domain)/\(api)/\(router)&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="type">Alamofire</span>.request(url).responseDecodable(completionHandler: completionHandler)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now, we can implement different Requests as needed: </p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title">ARequset</span>: <span class="title">MYRequest</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">let</span> router = <span class="string">&quot;a&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">typealias</span> <span class="type">T</span> = <span class="type">A</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title">BRequset</span>: <span class="title">MYRequest</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">let</span> router = <span class="string">&quot;b&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">typealias</span> <span class="type">T</span> = <span class="type">B</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In addition, we can define another protocol with the same protocol <code>var api: String &#123;get &#125;</code> in <code>MYRequest</code> if we have a new <code>CRequset</code> and the API is upgraded to v2 </p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">protocol</span> <span class="title">V2</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> api: <span class="type">String</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">get</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="title">V2</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> api: <span class="type">String</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;v2&quot;</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title">C</span>: <span class="title">Request</span>, <span class="title">V2</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">let</span> router = <span class="string">&quot;c&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">typealias</span> <span class="type">T</span> = <span class="type">C</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Finally, the request in ViewController will look like this: </p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="type">ARequset</span>().request &#123; [<span class="keyword">weak</span> <span class="keyword">self</span>] response <span class="keyword">in</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">let</span> a = response.result.value &#123; <span class="comment">// a is A, not Any</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="type">BRequset</span>().request &#123; [<span class="keyword">weak</span> <span class="keyword">self</span>] response <span class="keyword">in</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">let</span> b = response.result.value &#123; <span class="comment">// b is B, not Any</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I have admired the base series for a long time. This is the first Clark novel to be read completely. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h3 id="translation"><a href="#translation" class="headerlink" title="translation"></a>translation</h3><p>Let me talk about translation </p>
<p>About two years ago, I had the original version and decided not to read the translation<br>I haven’t read it. Another earlier version met with Rama, so I didn’t post a comparison.<br>As far as this version is concerned, there is no imaginary sense of violation<br>As far as the name is concerned, Rama must be wrong, because the original text contains: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>now they were working through the Gindu pantheon. And so 31/439 was christened Rama. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Cover"><a href="#Cover" class="headerlink" title="Cover"></a>Cover</h3><p>And I like this cover<br>When I first got the book, I thought it was something like a gravitational lens. I was completely misled. I didn’t expect it to be Rama. </p>
<h3 id="Technology"><a href="#Technology" class="headerlink" title="Technology"></a>Technology</h3><p>On the whole, the only thing that feels wrong is the interstellar spacecraft, and the chimpanzee who does chores<br>Judging from the current level of technology, those doing these things should be more like robots in Interstellar (you see, Rama civilization is also made by Jiangzi)<br>The human physiology described in the book has not improved much compared to now<br>It’s hard to imagine that humans are still like this when they move as far as Pluto (in the book, Pluto is still a planet rather than a dwarf planet). </p>
<p>You know, I felt like I was going to die when I went to Europe for an 11-hour flight. When I did this kind of interstellar travel, it was not a corpse anymore. </p>
<p>So if humans don’t iteratively upgrade as described in “Life 3.0”<br>Compared to humans, the humanoid robots in nier automata are more suitable for interstellar travel </p>
<p>Others are great<br>For example, although Rama’s intelligent life did not show up at the end, it is inferred that it should be similar to humans.<br>The mainstream view of science until now is that carbon-based life is because: </p>
<ol>
<li>Macromolecules need carbon and silicon to be linkers </li>
<li>Silicon needs extremely high temperatures to become active </li>
<li>The carbon in the entire universe is 10 times that of silicon </li>
</ol>
<p>Then Rama is the robot, which has specific functions, weak artificial intelligence, and does not need to be conscious </p>
<h3 id="Rama-people"><a href="#Rama-people" class="headerlink" title="Rama people"></a>Rama people</h3><p>The book is only in Liuli Shrine (I’m sorry I saw the glass and the temple is turned into a shrine ⛩️) That chapter describes the creatures in the crystal, why guess that this is Rama’s advanced intelligent creature? </p>
<p>Because if you see a 📱 in the universe, you will definitely not think that it was formed naturally, it must be created by some kind of intelligent life </p>
<h3 id="Nuclear-bomb-from-Mercury"><a href="#Nuclear-bomb-from-Mercury" class="headerlink" title="Nuclear bomb from Mercury"></a>Nuclear bomb from Mercury</h3><p>When I saw it, I was worried about Rama being destroyed.<br>But to me, the Mercury people are not wrong, their speeches also make sense </p>
<p>If we pause here, treat it as a thought experiment<br>In the end, Rama really occupied the near-solar orbit. Originally, he had this opportunity to preserve human civilization. As a result, human civilization disappeared because of a person’s hypocrisy. The person who detonated the nuclear bomb was not a hero but a sinner. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Survival is the first need of civilization </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, for the human beings who have just stepped out of the solar system, there is no difference from the situation when they stepped out of Africa that year. When facing a dangerous environment again, how can they treat space in the way of modern civilization on Earth? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>do not go gentle into that good night </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, from the perspective of Rama, where the sun is only 5 million kilometers behind, it opens the protective cover, draws energy, and violates Newton’s third law of movement. It is not important whether the nuclear bomb is or not, but it highlights that it is actually a human species-level struggle </p>
<h3 id="civilization"><a href="#civilization" class="headerlink" title="civilization"></a>civilization</h3><p>Human evolution has led to no conception of unusual sizes that cross daily levels </p>
<p>According to the description in the book, it is 50 kilometers long and 20 kilometers in diameter, so the circumference is 62.8 kilometers, so it seems that the entire inner wall area is 3,140 kilometers. What is the concept? </p>
<ul>
<li>Three ten thousandths of our country </li>
<li>Beijing Sixth Ring Road 2,267 km² </li>
<li>Shanghai 6,340 km² </li>
<li>Shenzhen 2,050 km² </li>
<li>Hong Kong 2,754 km² </li>
</ul>
<p>Feel it for yourself </p>
<p>Think about the current population of these cities, so such an area can fully carry the population base required by a human civilization<br>Not to mention the low gravity in the middle of Rama. Now the city skyscrapers are only a few hundred meters away. Rama is 10 kilometers away, which is two orders of magnitude worse, so the actual capacity<br>Not surface area but volume<br>Moreover, Rama should be just one of them, after all </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rama is the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The List that Avatars in the Dashavatara Waris by Reason: Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Balarama and Kalki </p>

    <title>How to convert video to text</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>If the audio is Mandarin, I find that XFyun FlySpeechRecognizer does a good job in this matter. It can even recognize some simple English words in mixed language audio. </p>
<p>There is no need to train a machine learning model from the beginning to do such a thing. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>XFyun API has some limitations. The size should be less than or equal to 2MB, and the audio length should be less than or equal to 60s. </p>
<p>Usage <code>./test.sh test.mp4</code> </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/bin/zsh</span></span><br><span class="line">filename=$(<span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="variable">$1</span> | cut -d. -f1)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">type</span>=$(<span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="variable">$1</span> | cut -d. -f2)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># print $filename.$type </span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># split video &lt;= 2MB </span></span><br><span class="line">mp4box -splits 2000 <span class="variable">$filename</span>.<span class="variable">$type</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># echo video → audio pcm </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> name <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="variable">$filename</span>\_*.<span class="variable">$type</span>; <span class="keyword">do</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">print</span> <span class="string">&quot;ffmpeg <span class="variable">$name</span> to pcm&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">  ffmpeg -y  -i <span class="variable">$name</span> -acodec pcm_s16le -f s16le -ac 1 -ar 16000 <span class="variable">$name</span>.pcm</span><br><span class="line">  rm <span class="variable">$name</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">done</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># audio to text </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> name <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="variable">$filename</span>\_*.pcm; <span class="keyword">do</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">print</span> <span class="string">&quot;xfyun.py <span class="variable">$name</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">  python3 xfyun.py <span class="variable">$name</span></span><br><span class="line">  rm <span class="variable">$name</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">done</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now we can use XFyun to recognize audio. </p>

<p>The good news is that they all support the <code>PCM</code> type converted earlier, so I need to make some changes to the shell. When you want to compare the results from different recognizers, just run: </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Games have changed my life. </p>
<p>I have been to cities for many years. These cities have had travels in the Assassin’s Creed series, including “Sleeping Dog 2”, “GTA” and so on.<br>When I actually enter the real world, it will have a big impact. Therefore, every time I go back, I always want to experience it in the game. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>However, as I get older and older 👴, I spend less and less time playing games 👱. </p>
<p>I am recording 🎮 while playing 📹, this might be a good idea. </p>
<h2 id="ShadowPlay"><a href="#ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="ShadowPlay"></a>ShadowPlay</h2><p>Since I have a Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1080 to train deep learning models, the only thing I need is Nvidia ShadowPlay, which is very suitable for recording games. </p>
<p>But the minimum bit rate is 10Mbps, I want to reduce it below 6kbps, so compression is involved 🗜️. </p>
<h2 id="Staxrip"><a href="#Staxrip" class="headerlink" title="Staxrip"></a>Staxrip</h2><p>I always use FFmpeg before, but every time I hear the sound of a Macbook, I feel panic. I usually spend an entire night to convert the batch video. </p>
<p>Fortunately, this time I saw the Cuda logo, which reminded of the acceleration of the GPU. </p>
<p>Then I found <a href="https://github.com/stax76/staxrip">staxrip</a>, which is incredible. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>x264</strong>, select <strong>NVIDIA H.265</strong> (I tested on my 1080, its speed is similar to NVIDIA H.264, I used to think 264 should be much faster than 265), and then it You can use GPU acceleration. </li>
<li>Click <code>Encoder Options</code>, change the mode to <code>VBR</code>, and then “Video Bit Rate” appears. </li>
</ol>
<p>It can reach 250 frames per second when CPU is 40% and GPU is 35%. </p>

</tbody></table>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>As an iOS developer who happily follows the  steps, when I first set foot in iOS developers, I used Swift, Storyboard and AutoLayout. </p>
<p>I think this is why most native developers are not even willing to learn React Native. </p>
<p>Two years ago, I established Mattermost and made some changes in the previous company to replace Slack. This was the first React Native project I came into contact with. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s very easy to lose code, and every time I want to change something, I have to search the entire project. There is no Storyboard to let me know who told who. </p>
<p>I chatted with my former colleague, who was an advanced front end. He helped me start the update server, which was also written in Node.js. I handed over this project to him when I left. </p>
<p>According to him, this is because he doesn’t know how to write native code, just like React React is similar to React.js, why not use it to try both iOS and Android. Then I asked him if he knew how to develop quickly and what kind of technology he would like. You can guess the answer 😄. </p>
<p>Because from my point of view, it is sometimes difficult to implement functions even in fast code, which is definitely a long way to go for another technology to achieve. </p>
<p>Then, these days, I have the opportunity to conduct a demo with nested magnet scroll views, buttons and navigation. Instead of using native code, I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried React Native and Flutter. </p>
<ul>
<li>Views <ul>
<li>ListView, ScrollView, Labels, Texts, TextFields </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actions <ul>
<li>Drag, Click, Scroll </li>
<li>Callback Block or Delegate on view events </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, if you are proficient in any of them, all that remains is how Google implements it in the framework or read its manual. </p>
<h2 id="React-Native"><a href="#React-Native" class="headerlink" title="React Native"></a>React Native</h2><p>The impressive thing about React Native is <strong>state</strong> </p>

<h2 id="Flutter"><a href="#Flutter" class="headerlink" title="Flutter"></a>Flutter</h2><p>I used to be curious about certain applications that UX is very similar to those developed by this machine, but it feels weird in some way. Now I know it is shaking. </p>
<ul>
<li>This is my first time to write and get two apps (I have a lot of trouble setting up React Native with Android) </li>
<li>0.9 There is an error on the hot install </li>
<li>The development on Visual Studio Code is quite good, which reminds me of the past of Golang </li>
<li>Ugly code style (Are they serious about it? This is an official example) </li>

<p>In any case, I was really impressed by it, it skipped the <code>native components</code> and wrote its own 2D rendering engine. Much more talented than React Native. </p>
<p>Therefore, personally, I think Flutter has more potential than React Native. And there are many companies rolling back to local. </p>

<p>To me, it is surprising that SpriteKit can have similar development experience as using Storyboard. </p>
<p>When I saw Paul Hegarty ctrl drag the button to code in his class, the main reason I surrendered to iOS Dev was Storyboard. </p>
<p>Excellent! </p>
<p>In addition, I saw a lot of UIDynamic things that I used to set through code. </p>
<p>It is a pleasure to carry out this brief exploration. </p>

<p>It seems that feedback is indeed a high-level skill </p>
<p>It’s a pity that our little mage is and has been in the Junior stage for a long time </p>
<p>Plus the following two reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>Rubbish spoken </li>

</ol>
<p>Feedback has become an insurmountable obstacle for Little Mage </p>

<p>One afternoon the little mage was worrying about consuming coffee crazily<br>Under the effect of caffeine, a whim<br>Although I am weak<br>But it doesn’t mean that Shenlong cannot be summoned at all. </p>

    <title>Uber booking animation</title>
    <url>/Uber-Booking-Animation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In June of this year, I joined WWDC in San Jose. It was the waiting animation I saw when I met my friends at the Cupertino Library using Uber. </p>
<p>The animation is awesome! </p>
<p>I was curious how they did it, so I did some exploration. </p>
<h2 id="Preview"><a href="#Preview" class="headerlink" title="Preview"></a>Preview</h2><video width="360" autoplay loop muted="true" >
<source type="video/mp4" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/UberBookingAnimation.mp4">
</video>

<p>Well, the polyline animation is still not smooth enough. Does anyone have a better idea? </p>

<ul>
<li>After WWDC19, Simulator is built on the Meta and Core layers of all Apple frameworks included in MapKit, and Metal uses the GPU of the underlying Mac system. </li>
<li>Google Map requires a developer key to access, which means that after forking the repository from GitHub, you cannot run it directly on the emulator </li>
</ul>
<p> Map transactions can be adjusted by embedding in the <code>UIView.animate</code> block </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In fact, subtracting unnecessary clips from 4k video can save space more effectively </p>
<hr>
<p>When I gallery videos in “Photos”, it will show when and where I took them </p>
<p>This is a great feature that can help me recall my memories<br>But the original 4k takes up too much space in iCloud </p>
<p>For example, even with HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), a 2:30 video will occupy 1GB of space<br>My 200G iCloud plan is almost full ​​ </p>
<p>Therefore, I plan to compress the video a bit to save some space. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>but, </p>

<li>Exiftool </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Export-original-video-to-folder"><a href="#Export-original-video-to-folder" class="headerlink" title="Export original video to folder"></a>Export original video to folder</h4><p>The common way to drag a video from “Photo” to a folder is to let “Photo” convert the video </p>
<p>Therefore, you must select all the videos you want to export, </p>

<h4 id="Shrink-each-video"><a href="#Shrink-each-video" class="headerlink" title="Shrink each video"></a>Shrink each video</h4><p>iPhone default stream is </p>
<p><code># 0: 0 (and): Video: hevc (Main) (hvc1 / 0x31637668), yuv420p (tv, bt709)</code> </p>
<p>So using <code>-pix_fmt yuv420p10le</code> to re-encode to 10bit does not help </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="title">ffmov</span></span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    mkdir -p shrunk</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># ffmpeg with h265 </span></span><br><span class="line">    ffmpeg -i <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$1</span>&quot;</span> -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a copy -c:s copy -tag:v hvc1 shrunk/<span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$1</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    overwriteExif <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$1</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="title">overwriteExif</span></span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># copy Exif info from the original video to the shrunk *.mov </span></span><br><span class="line">    exiftool -tagsFromFile <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$1</span>&quot;</span> shrunk/<span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$1</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    exiftool shrunk/<span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$1</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    rm shrunk/<span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$1_original</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="title">shrinkVideos</span></span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">## walk through all *.mov </span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> f <span class="keyword">in</span> *.mov</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">do</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="variable">$f</span></span><br><span class="line">        ffmov <span class="variable">$f</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">done</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Then, you can copy and paste these codes into <code>Terminal</code> and <code>cd VideoFolder</code>, then <code>shrinkVideos</code> </p>
<p>Shrinking will take a long time </p>
<p>On my MacBook Pro (15 inches, 2018), it’s only 0.3 times<br>But usually, the video will be reduced by 5 times without losing too much quality </p>
<p>When all is done, the reduced video will be located under the <code>shrunk/</code> folder </p>
<p>You can then compare them and delete the original video before importing the reduced video </p>
<p>Okay, in the end I can’t stand the extremely slow speed, so I use Nvidia 1080 GPU for acceleration to learn more: [CUDA GPU Accelerated h264/h265/HEVC Video Encoding with Staxrip](<a href="https://leihao0.github.io">https://leihao0.github.io</a> /CUDA-GPU-Accelerated-h264-h265-HEVC-Video-Encoding-with-Staxrip/) </p>
<p>The next step is to mark the converted video as <code>hvc1</code>, otherwise, an error will occur when importing photos: </p>
<p><strong>Invalid: The operation couldn’t be completed. (PHPhotosErrorDomain error -1.)</strong> </p>
<p>So the whole step is </p>

<p>Children have no concept of life and death, and the cemetery is more like an amusement park for them </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<hr>
<p>Thank you 🙏 🐼 reader for sending another book </p>
<p>Ashamed, the number of readings plummeted after going abroad<br>From hundreds of books per year before suddenly to single digits now </p>
<p>Think about the boastful saying that reading should not be utilitarian, but should be driven by interest<br>Now it’s really slap in the face </p>
<p>But there are also objective reasons: </p>
<p>One is that most of the books I want to read now have original editions<br>Since there is the original version, I don’t really want to see the translated version </p>
<p>Secondly, I was on a phone call and was heard by a friend from the National University of Singapore<br>After that, she repeatedly despised “Your Plastic English” </p>
<p>But I have my stubbornness, slow is slow, but I stick to the original version<br>There should be one day I can get up as fast as Chinese books </p>
<p>The third is that Po County is an island, and there is no such thing as the good mountains and rivers abroad, so lonely as the gods say<br>And at the beginning of this epidemic, I once thought that this place was a developed country in a mess<br>In addition, it is summer all year round, except for the hotter, other things are quite comfortable<br>The blue sky and white clouds, heavy rain and thunder, feel like time is frozen, it’s good </p>
<p>Without utilitarianism, naturally there is no motivation to read </p>
<p>Circuit Breaker is now, so I have some time and mood </p>
<hr>
<p>I got this book first<br>I thought it was science fiction at the beginning<br>I heard that I could be invisible and thought it was fantasy<br>I thought it was love when I met sister paper<br>Went to school and thought it was a campus<br>Dad came to the game and thought it was a parent-child<br>The whole family was killed and thought it was suspense<br>In the end, I was talking about growth </p>
<p>As the last author wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I finished the sixth chapter, “Bertie’s School Days” in a shabby hotel in New Orleans. I finished the last page in the gazebo in my garden, holding back tears while writing. Only at that moment, I understood why I didn’t write this book when I was a father. Because before creating, I have to accompany my children through their growth process, nurture them, love them, and finally learn to let go </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In addition, it’s hard to get involved in the reading process<br>The whole book keeps giving me the feeling of a Harry Potter copy </p>
<p>But there is a significant difference in reading this time<br>In the past, when reading such novels, I often entered the book from the perspective of the protagonist<br>With age<br>This time it’s more from Silas’ perspective </p>
<p>If this book is a common fantasy routine in China<br>Bod will definitely pick up sister Scarlett, tame Sleer, become Master, tear Jack, sit as Brotherhood boss </p>
<p>However, none of this happened in Neil, who wrote about the American Gods.<br>After Bod played the monster 👾, the sister paper was scared away. Bod is just an ordinary <strong>The world is so big, I want to see</strong> </p>
<p>As a father, do you want to see your Bod become the one in the country or the one in the book 📖? </p>
<hr>
<p>There are sometimes stupid things done during the rebellious period that require parents to pay for it<br>Now that I’m older, I understand the difficulties of the parents’ various prohibitions. </p>
<p>But I can’t help thinking about it<br>I didn’t know what I knew now </p>
<p>I have imagined that if the self now and the self then<br>I would definitely not be obedient at that time<br>You must be hammered in the face by the iron fist of society to wake up<br>Do something resolutely </p>
<hr>
<p>After dealing with the general affairs, one day he will step out of the fairy tale world and enter life </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Good-bye, then, Silas.” Bod held out his hand, as he had when he was a small boy, and Silas took it, in a cold hand the color of old ivory, and shook it gravely.<br>“Good-bye, Nobody Owens.”<br>Bod picked up the little suitcase. He opened the door to let himself out of the crypt, walked back up the gentle slope to the path without looking back.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was miserable when I came out, no one gave me away, no goodbye<br>The rent in Beijing was refunded and I bought a one-way ticket<br>All the belongings are packed in three suitcases<br>Take a taxi to the airport at 4 in the morning<br>After finishing the consignment, boarding, and then leaving </p>
<blockquote>
<p>without looking back </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How I wish I also heard Bod’s auditory hallucinations: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>He took a step forward … a voice said, “I am so proud of you, my son.” </p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Python vs Java for children</title>
    <url>/Python-vs-Java-for-Kids/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><em>The</em> <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/guide/python-vs-java/"><em>Article</em></a> _ originally appeared in_ <a href="https://junilearning.com/"><em>junilearning.com</em></a> </p>
<h1 id="Python-and-Java-usage-performance-learning"><a href="#Python-and-Java-usage-performance-learning" class="headerlink" title="Python and Java: usage, performance, learning"></a>Python and Java: usage, performance, learning</h1><p>In the field of computer science, there are many programming languages, and no one language is superior to another. In other words, <strong>each language is best for solving certain problems</strong>. In fact, for a given programming project, there is usually no one best language to choose from. Therefore, for students who want to develop software or solve interesting problems through code, it is very important to have a strong foundation in computer science ** applicable to any programming language**. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Programming languages tend to share certain characteristics in the way they work, for example, they deal with memory usage or the intensity of using objects. As students become exposed to more languages, they will begin to see these patterns. This article will focus on Python and Java, the two most widely used programming languages in the world. Although it is difficult to accurately measure the growth rate of each programming language, <strong>They are the two most popular programming languages used in industry today</strong>. </p>
<p>The main difference between Python and Java is that Python is <strong>dynamically typed</strong>, while Java is <strong>statically typed</strong>. Loosely speaking, this means that Java is stricter on how to define and use variables in the code. *<em>As a result, the syntax of Java tends to be verbose, which is one of the reasons why we recommend that beginners learn Python before Java. *</em>For example, this is how <code>numbers</code> creates a name variable in Python that holds the numbers 0 to 9: </p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">numbers = []</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">10</span>):</span><br><span class="line">numbers.append(i)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here’s how you would do the same thing in Java: </p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ArrayList numbers = <span class="keyword">new</span> ArrayList();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">int</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="number">10</span>; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    numbers.add(i);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Another major difference is that Java is a <strong>compiled language</strong>, so it usually runs programs faster than Python. This means that the compiler converts Java code into machine-level code before actually running the program. In contrast, Python is an <strong>interpreted</strong> language, which means there are no compilation steps. </p>
<h2 id="Usage-and-practicality"><a href="#Usage-and-practicality" class="headerlink" title="Usage and practicality"></a>Usage and practicality</h2><p>Historically, Java has become a more popular language, partly because of its long history. However, Python is rapidly gaining popularity. According to <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">Github’s October Status Report</a>, it has recently surpassed Java as the most widely used programming language. According to the 2018 Developer Survey, <strong>Python is now the fastest growing computer programming language</strong>. </p>
<p>Both Python and Java have a large developer community, and you can answer questions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> websites. From <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python%2Cjava">Stack Overflow Trends</a>, it can be seen that the percentage of questions asked by Python on Stack Overflow in 2017 exceeds that of Java**. At the time of writing, about 13% of questions on Stack Overflow are marked with Python, and about 8% are marked with Java! </p>
<h2 id="Web-development"><a href="#Web-development" class="headerlink" title="Web development"></a>Web development</h2><p>** Both Python and Java can be used for back-end web development**. Typically, developers will use the <a href="https://stackify.com/python-frameworks/">Django and Flask</a> framework for Python and <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> for Java. Python is known for the readability of its code, which means that Python code is clean, easy to read and concise. Python also has a large number of comprehensive modules, packages, and libraries. These modules, packages, and libraries are developed by the Python enthusiast community, in addition to its standard library. Java has a similar ecosystem, although to a lesser extent. </p>
<h2 id="Mobile-application-development"><a href="#Mobile-application-development" class="headerlink" title="Mobile application development"></a>Mobile application development</h2><p><strong>When it comes to mobile application development, Java has a dominant position</strong> because <strong>Java</strong> is the main language used to build Android applications and games. With the above-mentioned tailor-made libraries, developers can choose to write Android applications using powerful frameworks and development tools built specifically for the operating system. Currently, although there are tools such as <a href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a> and <a href="https://beeware.org/">BeeWare 之</a> that allow you to write code once and run it on Windows, OS X, iOS and Deploy applications on Android, but Python is not often used for mobile development. </p>
<h2 id="Machine-learning-and-big-data"><a href="#Machine-learning-and-big-data" class="headerlink" title="Machine learning and big data"></a>Machine learning and big data</h2><p>In contrast, in machine learning and <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/coding-and-data-science">data science</a>, Python is the most popular language. Python is commonly used in big data, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) projects. <strong>When working on projects involving sentiment analysis, most data scientists and machine learning programmers choose to use Python instead of Java</strong>. At the same time, it is worth noting that many machine learning programmers may choose to use Java when working on projects related to network security, network attack prevention, and fraud detection. </p>
<h2 id="Where-to-start"><a href="#Where-to-start" class="headerlink" title="Where to start"></a>Where to start</h2><p>When learning the basics of programming, <strong>many studies have reached the conclusion</strong>, because of the simple and intuitive syntax of Python, it is <strong>easier than Java</strong> <strong>**</strong>[Learn Python](https ://junilearning.com/coding)<em><em>, as shown in the previous example. Compared with Python, Java programs usually have more boilerplate code-they must contain parts of the code with little or no changes in many places. Having said that, Java has some significant advantages, especially its speed as a compiled language. *</em>Learning Python and Java will expose students to two languages, which are based on similar computer science concepts but differ in education. *\</em> </p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that Python and Java are both powerful programming languages in practice, so for any aspiring software developer, it is best to learn both languages proficiently. Programmers should compare Python and Java according to the specific needs of each software development project, rather than simply learning a language they like. In short, no one language is superior to another, so programmers should strive to have both languages in both codings**. </p>

<p>This is because the CPU is too hot 🔥 even if you think it’s not hot 🥶… </p>
<p>In addition, <code>kernel_task</code> is not the culprit. When the CPU is not hot, its occupancy rate will automatically go down… </p>

<p>In the era of <strong>big data</strong>, we frequently come into contact with data in daily life through navigation (GPS), online shopping, energy usage, and wearable devices such as smart watches. </p>
<p>On average, each household has about [11 devices,](<a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/us-households-have-an-average-of-11-connected-devices-and-5g-should">https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/us-households-have-an-average-of-11-connected-devices-and-5g-should</a> -push-that-even-higher-1203431225/) And this number may increase in the future! With so many devices, companies need to process large amounts of data to provide services. </p>

<p>Python-based tools are often used to visualize, process, and analyze large amounts of data. </p>
<p><strong>Data Science</strong> involves processing data and inferring trends<strong>-Python</strong> is very useful in this field because it contains dense packages such as <strong>scipy</strong>, <strong>numpy</strong> and <strong>pandas</strong>. </p>
<p>In addition, the <strong>matplotlib</strong> software package can be used to build data visualizations. This makes Python a popular choice in fields such as <strong>bioinformatics</strong>, which also involves large amounts of data and modeling. </p>
<p>These Python-based tools have become popular because of their ease of use and scalability. For example, <a href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/how-netflix-uses-python/#hownetflixusespython">Netflix</a> uses <strong>scipy</strong> and <strong>numpy</strong> for numerical calculations to manage cross-platform users flow. </p>

<h3 id="artificial-intelligence"><a href="#artificial-intelligence" class="headerlink" title="artificial intelligence"></a>artificial intelligence</h3><p>Machine learning is actually just one aspect of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. AI refers to the intelligence of machines and the development of computer systems to perform human-oriented tasks such as perception or decision-making. </p>
<p>An outstanding example of artificial intelligence is ride-hailing applications such as <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/mrop88jh71hl/dlvfPv6HAIV4YaMb1TRCl/88739612a93476c94733255a94a567d7/python-artificial-intelligence-in-ride-sharing.png" alt="Python illustration of artificial intelligence used in carpooling applications. "> </p>
<p>Python is used in artificial intelligence for applications such as Lyft or Uber. The AI system can then predict things such as user needs and estimated time of arrival. </p>
<p>Uber uses AI to <strong>predict user needs</strong> and <strong>estimated arrival time</strong> (and other features), most of which are through [Python](<a href="https://eng.uber.com/uber-ai-blog">https://eng.uber.com/uber-ai-blog</a> -2019/) completed. </p>
<p>In addition to some of the aforementioned Python libraries, other libraries such as <strong>keras</strong> and <strong>pytorch</strong> can also be used to create AI functions (such as predictive models and neural networks). </p>
<h2 id="Python-is-everywhere"><a href="#Python-is-everywhere" class="headerlink" title="Python is everywhere!"></a>Python is everywhere!</h2><p>Among popular programming languages, Python is one of the most diverse languages in its applications. In addition, it has been deeply integrated with us and today’s leading companies. </p>
<p>Occupations involving Python include <strong>software engineer, web developer, data scientist, product manager, business analyst</strong>, etc. Regardless of the industry, companies in this technological age rely on data-driven decision making, and Python is the perfect tool to do this. </p>
<p>If you or your child is interested in the fields or roles listed above, then learning Python is a good choice! </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>refer code <code>0CM1QE</code> </p>
<p>US elections these two days<br>As leeks, don’t share it because of the time difference.<br>Woke up in the middle of the night and cut the meat<br>Now seeing the 🚀 generally rising, but not dare to enter the market embarrassment </p>
<p>Just share the sad journey of opening an account at that time </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="U-S-brokerage"><a href="#U-S-brokerage" class="headerlink" title="U.S. brokerage"></a>U.S. brokerage</h2><p>Because many U.S. brokerages are exempt from commissions, so look first </p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood (better user interface) </li>
<li>TD Ameritrade (old brand) </li>
<li>Firstrade (Chinese customer service) </li>
</ul>
<p>Robinhood Because both parties can send stocks when invited, I asked my friends in the United States to get the code, and then I went to the official website and found that it can only be submitted within the United States…<br>TD Ameritrade does have SG and website, but I don’t know how to get stuck in the last step after submitting the information. No one has reviewed the email in the past.<br>Firstrade, non-Americans automatically helped to submit the tax exemption form. After submitting the information, the account was finally opened after a few working days, and then found that the deposit can only be ACH, Check, Wire Trannsfer </p>
<p>Both ACH and Check need to transfer money to my U.S. bank account, so definitely not<br>Wire Trannsfer has another fee </p>
<h2 id="Singapore-Brokerage"><a href="#Singapore-Brokerage" class="headerlink" title="Singapore Brokerage"></a>Singapore Brokerage</h2><p>Then I researched Singapore and found that these people actually went to UOB or DBS Bank’s Trading Account<br>I only heard that the handling fee is too expensive, not worth it </p>
<h2 id="Domestic-brokerage"><a href="#Domestic-brokerage" class="headerlink" title="Domestic brokerage"></a>Domestic brokerage</h2><p>Okay, I went around and came back… </p>
<ul>
<li>Xiaomi’s Tiger </li>
<li>Tencent’s Futu </li>
<li>Snowball </li>
</ul>
<p>I’m happy 🐯 support Singapore account opening, yes </p>
<ul>
<li>US stocks, Hong Kong stocks, Singapore stocks, Australian stocks… </li>
<li>Support pre post market, futures </li>
<li>lever </li>
</ul>
<p>I originally planned to upload passport and other information, anyway I prepared it before<br>It turns out that Singpass authentication is supported, and I clicked and jumped back and forth, and it was authenticated… </p>
<p>God knew it was so easy<br>Did I open it last year? </p>
<p>Otherwise, this time has already doubled<br>Or have jumped off the rooftop </p>
<h2 id="transaction-fee"><a href="#transaction-fee" class="headerlink" title="transaction fee"></a>transaction fee</h2><p>Because I don’t (dare) buy options<br>There are three additional expenses for normal trading </p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 2$ </li>
<li>0.1% of total stock </li>
<li>Sell 2$ </li>
</ul>
<p>So even if you accompany all your underwear, 🐯 will be full </p>
<h2 id="Refer-code"><a href="#Refer-code" class="headerlink" title="Refer code"></a>Refer code</h2><p>You can use my code <code>0CM1QE</code> </p>
<p>I think the current activity is both sides </p>
<ul>
<li>Free 5 commissions </li>
<li>Charge 2000SGD to get 30SGD, 3W to get 100SGD </li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there is no desire to refer at all<br>I remember that I used to give away a share of Ali’s stock. Could it be too high now? </p>
<h2 id="Transcript"><a href="#Transcript" class="headerlink" title="Transcript"></a>Transcript</h2><p>Let’s take a look at the global stock market boom in the past two days. I was scared at night for fear of being unable to sleep. I had a report card after the fierce operation. </p>

You can do the test directly when you find an approved hospital<br>There is a clinic right next to the apartment where the little mage lives. Walk for 5 minutes<br>Because there are no appointments, there are too many people, and I waited for about an hour<br>Drew blood and stabbed his nose<br>I’ve been afraid of this test before, but the Singaporean doctors are more gentle and not too uncomfortable </p>
<p>Here is a reminder that you must press for a while after the blood is drawn. The little brother in front of the blood drawn the blood and did not use the band-aid carefully 🩹 hold it down<br>As a result, the blood flowed into a river, and the clothes on the ground were covered with blood, it was terrible </p>

<p>Wearing biochemical suits and adding clothes becomes a big problem </p>
<p>After repeatedly reading CDC’s <a href="https://chinese.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html">Domestic Travel During the COVID-19 Epidemic</a>, the little master concluded </p>
<ul>
<li>Airplane has fresh air </li>
<li>Wear a mask </li>
<li>Not soft eyes and nose </li>

<p>The main route of infection of the new crown is the respiratory system. The little mage feels that wearing <strong>N95+surgical mask+goggles</strong> should be at ease </p>

<p>Eastern Airlines can only check one piece of baggage, and the excess amount needs to be purchased extra, one piece is 500 RMB<br>20% discount for advance purchase on the app </p>
<p>In addition to the health code just before boarding, you also need to use the Customs Passenger Mini Program to fill in an entry information </p>

<p>Shaking and shaking in the car, on the high speed<br>Fell asleep with the heater<br>I got off the high-speed car and stopped. I woke up and found that it was 10,000 red lights that I had to wait for late at night. </p>
<p>Stop and go, suffering </p>
<p>Because the isolation hotel is randomly assigned, the good expensive ones are cheap<br>But this time the little mage can no longer save money, just thinking </p>

<ul>
<li>Hotel 350 a day, you can use Alipay, WeChat, UnionPay and other methods to transfer money </li>
<li>Three meals 100 days a day, but it’s not a hotel’s catering, but an outsourced box lunch </li>

<blockquote>
<p>This article introduces how to enumerate the names of all files and folders on the hard disk under the Windows NTFS disk format, and use the STL of C++ to construct a hash table, as well as the GUI and worker threads of MFC, and finally realize the implementation based on the keywords entered by the user Search as simple as google keyword search, and then instantly return all matching files/folders and recursively get the system path of the file/folder. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: <strong>NTFS, fast, keyword, search, file path</strong> </p>
<h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1 Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2><p>The directory structure of Windows. In NTFS volumes, files are<br>Arranged in the form of B+ tree, press when searching for files in the directory<br>The B+ tree search method first searches the root node (starting from the root directory), and then compares the file name to be found with the file name corresponding to the child node in the root node to determine which child node corresponds to the storage area to search, and then Use the child node as the current root node and search again until the file is found. ^[1]^ </p>
<p>Although the search provided by the Microsoft system can search text content, the speed is very unsatisfactory. In most cases, we just want to know which folder on the computer the file is stored in, and this program solves this very well. </p>
<h2 id="2-Brief-introduction-to-NTFS"><a href="#2-Brief-introduction-to-NTFS" class="headerlink" title="2 Brief introduction to NTFS"></a>2 Brief introduction to NTFS</h2><h3 id="2-1-NTFS"><a href="#2-1-NTFS" class="headerlink" title="2.1 NTFS"></a>2.1 NTFS</h3><p>NTFS(New Technology File System)是 Windows<br>The standard file system of NT and later Windows. NTFS replaces the file allocation table (FAT) file system and provides a file system for Microsoft’s Windows series operating systems. NTFS has made several improvements to FAT and HPFS (High-Performance File System), for example, it supports metadata and uses advanced data structures to improve performance, reliability, and disk space utilization. ^[2]^ </p>
<h3 id="2-2-Current-situation"><a href="#2-2-Current-situation" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Current situation"></a>2.2 Current situation</h3><p>With NT-based Windows<br>With the popularity of 2000/XP, many individual users have begun to use NTFS. NTFS also uses clusters as a unit to store data files, but the cluster size in NTFS does not depend on the disk or partition size. Shrinking the cluster size not only reduces the waste of disk space, but also reduces the possibility of disk fragmentation. NTFS supports file encryption management function, which can provide users with a higher level of security assurance. ^[3]^ </p>
<h2 id="3-Preparation"><a href="#3-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="3 Preparation"></a>3 Preparation</h2><h3 id="3-1-Design-ideas"><a href="#3-1-Design-ideas" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Design ideas"></a>3.1 Design ideas</h3><p>Read all file names of the disk as data, and match in the data according to the keywords entered by the user. The correct path is returned to the user together with the path to facilitate opening the file. </p>
<p>The specific design idea is shown in Figure 3-1. </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/QSearch_00.jpg" alt="Figure 3-1 Design Ideas"> </p>
<p>The biggest advantage of a hash table is that it greatly reduces the time consumed for data storage and search, which can almost be regarded as a constant time; the cost is only to consume more memory. However, with more and more available memory, it is worthwhile to trade space for time. In addition, easier coding is also one of its characteristics. </p>
<h3 id="3-2-What-is-USN"><a href="#3-2-What-is-USN" class="headerlink" title="3.2 What is USN"></a>3.2 What is USN</h3><p>The top priority of the program is to read the USN. </p>
<p>USN 是 Update Service Number Journal or Change<br>The abbreviation of Journal, the function of recording the modified information in the NTFS volume, you can set the number of files and directories to be monitored in the partition, and record the modification time and content of the monitored object. </p>
<p>When the USN log is enabled, for each NTFS volume, when there is information about adding, deleting, and modifying files, NTFS uses the USN log to record and store it as<br>The format of USN_RECORD. </p>
<h3 id="3-3-Why-is-it-fast"><a href="#3-3-Why-is-it-fast" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Why is it fast"></a>3.3 Why is it fast</h3><p>The USN log is equivalent to the WORD directory and provides an index. Of course, when the content of the article changes, the USN log will record when the modification is made, but it does not record what is modified in it, so the index file is very small. And when you want to find the specific paragraph of the article, you don’t need to turn the mouse wheel wildly, just look at the table of contents directly, and you only need to hold down ctrl+mouse click to locate. </p>
<p>In the same way, when you want to find a certain file, you can find out whether the file exists directly by searching the USN log (that is, the established index). </p>
<p>PS: Although windows is not “everything is a file” (Unix/Linux<br>One of the basic philosophy of ), but the folder also exists in the form of a file, so you can also find the location through USN. </p>
<h3 id="3-4-Environment"><a href="#3-4-Environment" class="headerlink" title="3.4 Environment"></a>3.4 Environment</h3><p>Since the NTFS format is originally a patent of Microsoft, a series of API functions are provided for our convenient access. </p>
<p>As an old but classic Visual C++ 6.0<br>Programming tool, but there was no NTFS format at that time, so VC2005 was chosen as the integrated development environment, and it can only run on Windows systems after 2000. </p>

<p>Here we use the map library function ^[5]^ provided by STL, map is a collection of key-value pairs. map<br>The type can usually be understood as an associative array (associative<br>array): You can use the key as a subscript to get a value, just like the built-in array type. The essence of association is that the value of an element is associated with a specific key, rather than obtained by the position of the element in the array. </p>
<ol>
<li>Considering that if you implement the hash function yourself, there may be several bugs that affect the progress, it is better to use the stable map provided by STL to implement it. </li>

<h3 id="4-3-Interface"><a href="#4-3-Interface" class="headerlink" title="4.3 Interface"></a>4.3 Interface</h3><p>When starting a project, VC2005 provides command line (console) projects and GUI projects. Command line programming is very convenient, fast, practical, and relatively simple. If the console can meet the requirements, the interface is not necessary. Or sometimes the target platform cannot display the graphical user interface. but,<br>GUI has more obvious advantages, such as menu system and better interactivity. In addition, in the process of menu selection and moving data between fields,<br>The mouse is very useful, and the GUI is the way to go. Therefore, when writing the program, I first tested some intermediate data under the console, and then switched to the GUI interface when it was over. </p>
<p>MFC: Microsoft Foundation Classes, also known as MFC<br>, Is Microsoft’s response to “lowering Windows<br>The greatest contribution made by programming is bored, bored and difficult. MFC<br>Makes the generation of dialog boxes extremely simple. It also implements a message delivery system (message<br>dispatching), dealing with the easy mistakes of WPARAM and LP ARAM. MFC<br>It is even the driving force to lure some people into C++.<br>This program is implemented by MFC provided by Microsoft, as shown in Figure 4-2: </p>

<h4 id="4-3-1-KISS-principle"><a href="#4-3-1-KISS-principle" class="headerlink" title="4.3.1 KISS principle"></a>4.3.1 KISS principle</h4><p>The KISS principle is “Keep It Sample And<br>The abbreviation of “Stupid”, simplicity and ease of operation are the most important principles of design. </p>
<p>The KISS principle is probably the most respected in design, home improvement design, interface design<br>In terms of operational design, complex things are becoming more and more popular, while simple things are becoming more and more recognized. For example, these UI designs and our Chinese web pages are negative examples. “IKEA” (IKEA) simple and efficient home design and production ideas; “Microsoft” (Microsoft) “what you see is what you get” concept; “Google” (Google) simple and direct business style, without exception, follow The “kiss” principle. ^[7]^ </p>
<h4 id="4-3-2-Function"><a href="#4-3-2-Function" class="headerlink" title="4.3.2 Function"></a>4.3.2 Function</h4><p>Under the kiss principle, be as concise as possible. Add Editbox button listbox<br>menu^[8]^The functions of these controls are as follows: </p>

Thread starts faster, exits faster, and has less impact on system resources. </p>
<p>Also consider: </p>
<ol>
<li>Due to the limitation of io, it doesn’t make much sense to use multiple threads to read MFT at the same time on the same hard disk. </li>
<li>Disk access to MFT located in different partitions of the same hard disk may affect the speed instead. For computers with multiple hard disks, efficiency should be greatly improved. However, users of multiple hard drives may form a RAID array. The best solution should be to read A-Z disks sequentially. </li>
<li>When the MFC was first created, it was executed sequentially. As a result, the interface could not be displayed until all data statistics were completed. During this process, users would easily lose patience. </li>
<li>Finally decide a UI thread, a worker thread background statistics. </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="4-4-2-Start-a-Worker-thread-in-MFC"><a href="#4-4-2-Start-a-Worker-thread-in-MFC" class="headerlink" title="4.4.2 Start a Worker thread in MFC"></a>4.4.2 Start a Worker thread in MFC</h4><p>MFC has long added support for multithreading. In a typical MFC<br>In the program, the support of multithreading is hidden behind a lot of amazing work. MFC<br>Even attempts to strengthen certain Win32 concepts related to multithreading. </p>
<p>Both GUI and worker threads are started with AfxBeginThread(), but MFC uses the overloading nature of C++ functions to provide two different declarations for this function. The compiler will automatically select the correct one to use based on the parameters you provide. ^[9]^ </p>
<p>Use AfxBeginThread to start the thread.<br>pParam Any 4-byte value, used to pass to the new thread. It can be an integer, or a pointer, or just a zero. </p>
<p>Only the first two parameters are used here, the thread function in the object, and the object pointer </p>
<p>You can see two threads in the task manager, as shown in Figure 4-3 </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/QSearch_03.jpg" alt="Figure 4-3 Task Manager displays the number of threads"> </p>
<p>When the worker thread completes its task, it will automatically end and return to a thread. </p>

To exit the program, you need to right-click on the tray icon to exit. </p>
<p>Realize minimization without exiting the program, you can find files conveniently. </p>
<p>1) Minimize the display on the taskbar. </p>
<p>2) Click Close to exit to the tray icon without displaying it in the taskbar; double-click to reply to the display window. </p>
<p>3) Add menu to tray icon. </p>
<h3 id="4-5-Find"><a href="#4-5-Find" class="headerlink" title="4.5 Find"></a>4.5 Find</h3><h4 id="4-5-1-Wildcard"><a href="#4-5-1-Wildcard" class="headerlink" title="4.5.1 Wildcard"></a>4.5.1 Wildcard</h4><p>In actual applications, it’s impossible to remember the file name clearly, such as test.2012-5-14.txt, which often means “test<br>.txt”, so fuzzy search is needed. Because under the console, the file name is &lt;filename,<br>pfrn&gt; Create a hash table. If you want to implement fuzzy search, the hash table becomes unnecessary. You can directly use the container vector. </p>
<p>According to the actual situation, no strict wildcard is required, “*?”<br>Can solve most of the search problems, plus users generally may not know the use of wildcards, let alone regular expressions. So start with “space”<br>Instead of “*?”, implement Baidu<br>Google’s search method of separating keywords with spaces is a good solution. **** </p>
<h4 id="4-5-2-Case-order"><a href="#4-5-2-Case-order" class="headerlink" title="4.5.2 Case, order"></a>4.5.2 Case, order</h4><p>There are generally the following two situations: </p>
<ol>
<li>The user may not remember the case of the file name or path </li>
<li>Sometimes there are too many files, and strict capitalization may be required to filter the correct files </li>
<li>Can’t remember the order of keywords </li>
</ol>
<p>So provide the following two options: </p>
<ol>
<li>Strict case </li>
<li>No order </li>
</ol>
<p>According to the general situation, the default is: case-insensitive, sequential search </p>
<h4 id="4-5-3-User-privacy-and-system-path"><a href="#4-5-3-User-privacy-and-system-path" class="headerlink" title="4.5.3 User privacy and system path"></a>4.5.3 User privacy and system path</h4><ol>
<li>Consider that some folders are used to store users’ private files. </li>
<li>System folders, for example: <code>c:\windows\*</code> General users will not use it. The same search will only increase unnecessary files and burden the system. </li>
</ol>
<p>So it is necessary to add an exclude folder option, as shown in Figure 4-4 </p>
