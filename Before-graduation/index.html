    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For a while now, my mind has been racing with thoughts, but I have never had the time to put them into writing.<br>There have been various gatherings, ticket bookings, searching for rental information, and then the CET-6 exam. After that, in the evening, I hurried over to meet with the landlord and visited various neighborhoods to look at apartments.<br>Once the apartment was more or less decided, I finally took a moment to relax in the hotel, caressing the notebook.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<h2 id="Gatherings"><a href="#Gatherings" class="headerlink" title="Gatherings"></a>Gatherings</h2><p>This has always been something I dislike participating in. Arthur Schopenhauer’s essay “Either Vulgar or Lonely” might be a bit extreme, but it does hold some truth.<br>Perhaps it also has something to do with my introverted nature. According to the MBTI test, my introverted score was surprisingly high at 85. I have always preferred to stay quiet and peaceful rather than in crowded and noisy situations.<br>I also really dislike taking photos, I’m not sure if it’s because of a scene I saw in a movie I watched as a child called “Soul Captivation,” where taking a photo would suck away my soul and trap it on a small piece of paper, like in the movie “Inception,” where they implant ideas into the subconscious.<br>During middle school and high school graduations, I left in a hurry. I remember in the photos from high school, my water bottle was still on my desk, but I was nowhere to be seen.<br>This time, for graduation, I took quite a few photos, mostly with Chenjie and the rest of the group.</p>
<p>Youth is truly amazing, with such abundant innate vitality and endless possibilities.<br>I remember in my first year of college, I would stay up all night once a week, and during winter break, I would go to sleep at 3 or 4 in the morning every day. In the third year of college, I could clearly feel that my body couldn’t handle it anymore, and it became even more apparent in my fourth year. There was one time in the hotel when I couldn’t sleep until 3 am, and the next day when I looked in the mirror, I was surprised to see the dark circles under my eyes, which I had wondered about before when the female lead in novels mentioned having them. I never understood what they meant, and secretly laughed at them for not being able to regulate their body and not understanding wellness…</p>
<p>In the past, I always used writing to record the bits and pieces of my life at the time. Now, I think the only result is that when I recall my youth, I’ll see myself in an old and feeble state, experiencing the rebelliousness and emotions of youth, but not knowing what I looked like back then.</p>
<h2 id="Leaving-School"><a href="#Leaving-School" class="headerlink" title="Leaving School"></a>Leaving School</h2><p>Packing up my things, waiting for my brother to get off work.<br>When it was almost time, my roommates decisively went out to eat…<br>It was still my middle school classmate Cui Wei who helped me pack and carry my things. Wei Ge, thank you! When I was about to call you to meet up, I realized that I had left my phone in the dorm and you were already gone.<br>Even though you ran so fast, I still want to thank you.</p>
<p>At my brother’s house, when I saw their new house, I finally understood why I wanted to buy an apartment by myself. I had always thought about renting…</p>
<h2 id="CET-6-Exam"><a href="#CET-6-Exam" class="headerlink" title="CET-6 Exam"></a>CET-6 Exam</h2><p>As soon as I sat down in the exam room, a guy came over and introduced himself as “Mingji,” turns out he was also a member of Li Ge’s group.<br>I realized that he was a sophomore, shocked! I discovered that the entire left side was filled with sophomores… It’s no wonder there were so many absentees from the senior class, thankfully the class monitor and Chen were there. They persisted until the end, while the result didn’t really matter to me anymore.</p>
<h2 id="Hangzhou"><a href="#Hangzhou" class="headerlink" title="Hangzhou"></a>Hangzhou</h2><p>Over ten days ago, I started looking up information online, gathering various materials, and summarizing with mind maps.<br>On the night after the CET-6 exam, I had a small gathering with them and ate the most expensive noodles I’ve ever had. Then I boarded the train.<br>I set my alarm clock for 6:20, but just as I received a call from Xiaoqi, reminding me of something, she said she couldn’t sleep at night. And it turned out I was waking up almost every hour.<br>At a little past 5 in the morning, I went to the bathroom and went back to sleep. At 6, I suddenly woke up. I had a bit of nutrition drink, used Google Maps to locate myself, and realized that I was already in Yuhang District!<br>Wasn’t it supposed to be 6:40? Then I heard “Passengers going to Hangzhou, please disembark,” O__O”…</p>
<p>Once I got off the train, there was no awe-inspiring feeling. It seemed that the train station in my hometown wasn’t just for show.<br>Using Google Maps, I looked for bus route 49 and saw that there were buses stopping over there, so I went over, but after circling around, there were none.</p>
<p>Bus K49 arrived at the Union Building at 7:30. I went to the Rujia Hotel and found out that I couldn’t check in until 8 o’clock, so I left my backpack in storage and went downstairs to the company.<br>I entered through AB and saw somebody practicing Tai Chi. Since Daiying didn’t come, I watched for a while and then had a conversation with someone who was practicing Chen-style Tai Chi. They asked if I felt the energy, and I said my fingers felt a bit tingly when I opened my hands, and then I discussed their thoughts. They said it wasn’t bad o(╯□╰)o</p>
<p>It happened to be raining, and I was running around looking for apartments in the rain.<br>But as soon as I paid the deposit and started waiting, it stopped raining…</p>
<p>I had already heard that this place was very clean, and as I walked from the train station, it felt that way too.<br>But that was just my initial impression.<br>It wasn’t until I saw two girls walking barefoot on the road…<br>If it were in Hefei, there would be bloodshed…</p>
<p>Kawai once said to buy sandals, but I never felt the need.<br>One morning, as soon as I stepped outside, my sneakers got completely soaked.<br>It was then that I saw those two girls.<br>My perception suddenly changed, and later on, I discovered that many people were wearing flip-flops.<br>It seems that the image of middle-aged programmers wearing beach shorts and flip-flops is not just a rumor.</p>
<p>The online banking service of Huixing Bank for train ticket purchases couldn’t work on my computer.<br>The same issue happened at Haoge’s place, but when I used his computer, it worked perfectly fine.<br>I thought it was a problem with Internet Explorer 9, so I reset it to its initial state, but it didn’t work.<br>Helplessly, I reinstalled the system.<br>But it seemed like I got the wrong image, and it resulted in a blue screen…<br>And I didn’t have a system recovery USB, so I had to ask JS for a system disk.<br>Originally, I thought the company was an IT company, so having a system disk was a must. I didn’t expect there to be a small IT department inside.</p>
<p>This time when I bought the train tickets to Jiaxing, it wasted half of my day, and in the end, my sister helped me buy them.<br>Local banks just don’t work outside of their region, of course, as long as I stay in Anhui, I have a comfortable experience using Huixing, I can’t blame it, I can’t blame it.</p>
<p>It feels strange to be going on a trip for the first time.<br>In the afternoon, I was still taking the CET-6 exam, and in the evening, after a nap, I was already in Hangzhou. Today, I have to go to Jiaxing.<br>For places I have never been to, I always feel like it’s an unexplored map in a real-time strategy game, dark and waiting for me to discover it.</p>
<p>I went to many places to look for apartments.<br>Here, I want to thank Ying Tong and Dai Tong for accompanying me in finding apartments in Hangzhou, where I was unfamiliar. Especially Dai Tong, even after the apartment was decided, she continued to accompany me in searching, despite her girlfriend urging her on, we persisted until the second-to-last apartment.</p>
<p>In the end, I rented an apartment for 1100 RMB per month. It didn’t have a TV, signal, wooden floor, window screen, mattress, or table and chairs. It only had one bedroom and one bathroom, and it was far from the company…</p>
