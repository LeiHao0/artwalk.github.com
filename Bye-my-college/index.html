    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I remember that when I first arrived in Hangzhou last time, I saw this beautiful city with lots of vegetation and seemed to express it once…<br>This kind of place that took four years and felt free for the first time in my life, it is not enough to meet again…<br>Of course, I don’t have any awesome experience worth writing about. I have passed it plainly, just express my feelings. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>After I got down to Level 6 two days ago, I have finished this thing that has dragged on for 3.5 years.<br>I think college years, in my life, really passed </p>
<p>I remember one night, I dreamed of N many mosquitoes, which made me itchy. I thought to myself, this magical horse breaks my dream, it is more uncomfortable than a bone<br>Then I stood in the graveyard…<br>Although I warn myself not to be afraid, dream, just feel it, taste it.<br>Okay, I was persuaded, and then I wanted to run, where should I go?<br>Hmm, my parents are right next door, just run to them<br>Parents and home have always been our shelter from the wind after our injuries. </p>
<p>It’s a pity. Then I woke up and found myself alone. In the rented house, the next door was a stranger I had never met before.<br>Really left and grown up<br>Remember a sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Independence means greater social responsibility, freedom means more tolerance, liberation means more self-management, and growing up means more effort.<br>I can’t help but think of the phrase “The great ability comes great responsibility.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I have always yearned for independence and freedom, but when I really got here, at a certain moment, there was still a kind of “light sadness” as the boss described. </p>
<p>Turn to the topic<br>My university is more fun<br>When I entered school, it was the second school I always despised in high school<br>Seriously, after half a year, nothing has changed<br>I skipped classes in my sophomore year, and I got a major<br>When the junior never goes to class again, the whole school is a book </p>
<h2 id="Level-6"><a href="#Level-6" class="headerlink" title="Level 6"></a>Level 6</h2><p>Actually there is no such thing as passing or failing<br>And, after graduation, my personal feeling is that the certificates are all gone<br>However, it is a comfort to parents. (Originally, I thought that the last time my dad came, it was the last time he gave me RMB. This time, it seems that I can blackmail them again. O(∩_∩)O)<br>Moreover, it can be regarded as a draw to an end to his university career. </p>
<p>of course……<br>If they knew… </p>
<p>Remember J.K. Rowling said in a speech at the graduation ceremony of Harvard University: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot remember telling my parents that I was studying Classics; they might well have found out for the first time on graduation day. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In college, I arrived late, retired early, skipped class, cheated, missed a course, retaken, and confessed my faults…<br>Counting it down, it seems that except for scholarships and bursaries, I haven’t gotten a fight, and everything else is basically satisfactory. </p>
<p>Of course, cheating has always been something I despise and even disgusting. I can stick to the principle of 60.<br>The most interesting thing is that he also practiced the “two armies at war, the heart is the best” in the “Sun Tzu Art of War” and finally “the soldier who fails to fight without fighting.”<br>So when fighting this, I really don’t know what the situation is. The principle is “If a person does not offend me, I will not offend; if a person offends me, it depends on the situation.” </p>
<p>Other things that seemed impossible in the junior year were gradually completed in the last period of time. </p>
<p>There are also regrets: the brand does not sound, job hunting and future development cannot be used as a stepping stone; strategic planning is not so perfect due to horizontal vision restrictions, etc. </p>
<p>Oh, yes, there is one that I should complete:<br>Go to China University of Science and Technology </p>
<p>Although my school (omitted), but the geographical location is unique<br>There are two medical schools and two large shopping malls nearby<br>It is very convenient to go shopping and go shopping<br>So every time I get together, others come to me </p>
<p>The most important thing is not far from the University of Science and Technology of China<br>It’s a pity that I didn’t use it, or never thought of it </p>
<p>Always feel good about myself<br>At the same time, it seems that there has always been a deep inferiority complex<br>I remember in the earliest days, I didn’t even dare to enter other schools<br>Keep your head down when passing by, passing by </p>
<p>When I was running around for a meager salary in my senior year, I had to face this fact.<br>Every day I run the job fairs of HKUST, all kinds of hard work </p>
<p>But I suddenly found out that most of them are almost the same (ordinary people), the same being cut off, the same being rejected<br>But the awesomeness is different. In my opinion, for a god-like company, the offer comes at your fingertips and it is no pity to reject it. </p>
<p>Isn’t there a saying that the strength of an individual has nothing to do with the group.<br>And in the group, the average IQ drops down. </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>I thought I would really leave in the future, and I never went home for more than a week<br>Decided to stop looking for an internship and stay with my parents quietly for a period of time<br>In the last two months, let me go out every day (Sang Xin)<br>Mom and Dad said that I stayed at home every day, didn’t go out, didn’t help with housework, and didn’t do anything, so I played games and went to bed in a daze.<br>In fact, during that time, I felt that I knew more than the previous three years<br>The most important thing is mental growth<br>I am very happy to see this magical world towards the end of the university<br>It’s a pity that it passed in a blink of an eye, and now I don’t have time to calm down and spend a long time studying. </p>
<p>Finally back to Hefei, nothing else, just to reply<br>We got together one last time, before I bid farewell to Hefei </p>
<p>Looking back at that time now, I am very moved<br>Not alone when I left </p>
<h2 id="in-case"><a href="#in-case" class="headerlink" title="in case"></a>in case</h2><p>I know that “if” is useless. It is repeatedly emphasized in mental books. It is a waste of time. It is better to focus on the present<br>Li Zongren said that if people live not from 1 to 80, but from 80 to 1 year old, 2/3 of people will become great men. </p>
<p>Just like in “The Gang of Men”, if time can be returned, I think it will be another ending </p>
<p>So, although I have no big regrets<br>But if I were to be in the last university, I would shorten the time and advance it half a year<br>After all, the higher the level, the tighter the time<br>Just went to college, suddenly liberated, madness is a must<br>The Warcraft game I have been playing crazy for a year, in fact, should be compressed to half a year, in the freshman year, I played crazy<br>Then get into programming, something more interesting than Warcraft<br>Get C in the sophomore year, look at the data structure<br>The junior finds a house and moves out of school. Go to the internship<br>Run a job fair two months before the senior year<br>Stay with your parents in the next time<br>Go out in the middle, fun, good-looking, pass the driver’s license<br>You can ask your parents to borrow funds (note that it is “borrowing”) </p>
<p>Of course, there is another possibility. If that guy was me now, it would be completely different today…<br>People’s cognition is always confined to the present, and looking back a few years later will only feel so naive and lack of thinking at the time. </p>
<p>Of course, of course, no if… </p>
<p>There is a path dependence theory in economics. It says that once people make a certain choice, it is like embarking on a path of no return. The force of inertia will make this choice constantly self-reinforcing and prevent you from walking easily. Get out. </p>
<p>Regardless of the original choice, it is a decision made by yourself, and you are responsible for yourself </p>
<p>After graduating, I suddenly felt that the possibility has dropped a lot. After all, there are certain things that have become established facts, and I cannot do it again.<br>Then suddenly I saw the old A in “Soldier Assault” and said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>twenty two? I see you like 70! …If I were you, I would definitely participate. Do you know why? Because I’m only 30, such a fun thing, I haven’t done enough yet<br>Yeah, I’m only 22, what a good number 22, a stupid age </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, don’t work, be hated, love someone. </p>
<p>I hope that after a few years, I look back again,<br>It’s not “Anything that doesn’t work well now has a time when it’s not working hard.”<br>It is “a little bit of a dream that is built, and you in the future will be grateful for your hard work now!” </p>
<p>Thousands of words, I can’t say enough, but there is a time to end </p>
<p>Goodbye, my university. </p>

<p>PS：<br>The hearts are mixed together, crumpled into pieces </p>
<p>Write and delete, delete and write<br>Save the draft, intermittently several times<br>Still out of place </p>
<p>I want to cry, but I feel like I am no longer a child </p>
<p>How many four years in life<br>Still have enough free time, four years of worry-free food and clothing </p>
<p>After that, we must constantly compromise between ideal and reality<br>As we grow older, we have a deeper understanding of society, as the feeling of powerlessness and paleness increases day by day, and gradually disappears </p>
<p>However, what I saw is a comfort to myself: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that in this radiant, rapidly changing living space, everyone has their own choice. My idea is very simple. I don’t have to wear beautiful clothes, and I don’t need to use rouge powder. The most serious, simple and active life is for me. Fascinated by the truth. </p>
