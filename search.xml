        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This</em> <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/guide/python-vs-java/"><em>article</em></a> <em>originally appeared on</em> <a href="https://junilearning.com/"><em>junilearning.com</em></a></p><h1 id="Python-vs-Java-Uses-Performance-Learning"><a href="#Python-vs-Java-Uses-Performance-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Python vs. Java: Uses, Performance, Learning"></a>Python vs. Java: Uses, Performance, Learning</h1><p>In the world of computer science, there are many programming languages, and no single language is superior to another. In other words, <strong>each language is best suited to solve certain problems</strong>, and in fact there is often no one best language to choose for a given programming project. For this reason, it is important for students who wish to develop software or to solve interesting problems through code to have <strong>strong computer science fundamentals that will apply across any programming language</strong>.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Programming languages tend to share certain characteristics in how they function, for example in the way they deal with memory usage or how heavily they use objects. Students will start seeing these patterns as they are exposed to more languages. This article will focus primarily on Python versus Java, which are two of the most widely used programming languages in the world. While it is hard to measure exactly the rate at which each programming language is growing, <strong>these are two of the most popular programming languages used in industry today</strong>.</p><p>One major difference between Python and Java is that Python is <strong>dynamically typed</strong>, while Java is <strong>statically typed</strong>. Loosely, this means that Java is much more strict about how variables are defined and used in code. <strong>As a result, Java tends to be more verbose in its syntax, which is one of the reasons we recommend learning Python before Java for beginners.</strong> For example, here is how you would create a variable named <code>numbers</code> that holds the numbers 0 through 9 in Python:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">numbers = []</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">10</span>):</span><br><span class="line">numbers.append(i)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here’s how you would do the same thing in Java:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ArrayList numbers = <span class="keyword">new</span> ArrayList();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">int</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="number">10</span>; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    numbers.add(i);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Another major difference is that Java generally runs programs more quickly than Python, as it is a <strong>compiled language</strong>. This means that before a program is actually run, the compiler translates the Java code into machine-level code. By contrast, Python is an <strong>interpreted</strong> language, meaning there is no compile step.</p><h2 id="Usage-and-Practicality"><a href="#Usage-and-Practicality" class="headerlink" title="Usage and Practicality"></a>Usage and Practicality</h2><p>Historically, Java has been the more popular language in part due to its lengthy legacy. However, Python is rapidly gaining ground. According to <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">Github’s State of the Octoberst Report</a>, it has recently surpassed Java as the most widely used programming language. As per the 2018 developer survey, <strong>Python is now the fastest-growing computer programing language</strong>.</p><p>Both Python and Java have large communities of developers to answer questions on websites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. As you can see from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python%2Cjava">Stack Overflow trends</a>, <strong>Python surpassed Java in terms the percentage of questions asked about it on Stack Overflow in 2017</strong>. At the time of writing, about 13% of the questions on Stack Overflow are tagged with Python, while about 8% are tagged with Java!</p><h2 id="Web-Development"><a href="#Web-Development" class="headerlink" title="Web Development"></a>Web Development</h2><p><strong>Python and Java can both be used for backend web development</strong>. Typically developers will use the <a href="https://stackify.com/python-frameworks/">Django and Flask</a> frameworks for Python and <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> for Java. Python is known for its code readability, meaning Python code is clean, readable, and concise. Python also has a large, comprehensive set of modules, packages, and libraries that exist beyond its standard library, developed by the community of Python enthusiasts. Java has a similar ecosystem, although perhaps to a lesser extent.</p><h2 id="Mobile-App-Development"><a href="#Mobile-App-Development" class="headerlink" title="Mobile App Development"></a>Mobile App Development</h2><p><strong>In terms of mobile app development, Java dominates the field</strong>, as it is the primary langauge used for building Android apps and games. Thanks to the aforementioned tailored libraries, developers have the option to write Android apps by leveraging robust frameworks and development tools built specifically for the operating system. Currently, Python is not used commonly for mobile development, although there are tools like <a href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a>and <a href="https://beeware.org/">BeeWare</a> that allow you to write code once and deploy apps across Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android.</p><h2 id="Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data"><a href="#Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data" class="headerlink" title="Machine Learning and Big Data"></a>Machine Learning and Big Data</h2><p>Conversely, in the world of machine learning and <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/coding-and-data-science">data science</a>, Python is the most popular language. Python is often used for big data, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence (A.I.) projects. <strong>The vast majority of data scientists and machine learning programmers opt for Python over Java while working on projects that involve sentiment analysis</strong>. At the same time, it is important to note that many machine learning programmers may choose to use Java while they work on projects related to network security, cyber attack prevention, and fraud detection.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Start"><a href="#Where-to-Start" class="headerlink" title="Where to Start"></a>Where to Start</h2><p>When it comes to learning the foundations of programming, <strong>many studies have concluded that it is easier to <a href="https://junilearning.com/coding">learn Python</a> over Java</strong>, due to Python’s simple and intuitive syntax, as seen in the earlier example. Java programs often have more boilerplate code - sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration - than Python. That being said, there are some notable advantages to Java, in particular its speed as a compiled language. <strong>Learning both Python and Java will give students exposure to two languages that lay their foundation on similar computer science concepts, yet differ in educational ways.</strong></p><p>Overall, it is clear that both Python and Java are powerful programming languages in practice, and it would be advisable for any aspiring software developer to learn both languages proficiently. Programmers should compare Python and Java based on the specific needs of each software development project, as opposed to simply learning the one language that they prefer. In short, <strong>neither language is superior to another, and programmers should aim to have both in their coding experience</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Python</th><th>Java</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Runtime Performance</td><td></td><td>Winner</td></tr><tr><td>Ease of Learning</td><td>Winner</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Practical Agility</td><td>Tie</td><td>Tie</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile App Development</td><td></td><td>Winner</td></tr><tr><td>Big Data</td><td>Winner</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><hr>]]></content>

I finished the last page in the gazebo in my garden, holding back tears while writing. Only at that moment, I understood why I didn’t write this book when I was a father. Because before creating, I have to accompany my children through their growth process, nurture them, love them, and finally learn to let go</p></blockquote><hr><p>In addition, it’s hard to get involved in the reading process<br>The whole book has always given me the feeling of a Harry Potter copy</p><p>But there is a significant difference in this reading<br>In the past, when reading such novels, I often entered the book from the perspective of the protagonist<br>With age<br>This time it’s more from Silas’ perspective</p><p>If this book is a common fantasy routine in China<br>Bod will definitely pick up sister Scarlett, tame Sleer, become Master, tear Jack, sit as Brotherhood boss</p><p>However, all this did not happen in Neil, who wrote about the American Gods.<br>After Bod played the monster 👾, the sister paper was scared off, and Bod is just an ordinary <strong>The world is so big, I want to see</strong></p><p>As a father, do you want to see your Bod become the one in the country or the one in the book 📖?</p><hr><p>There are also some stupid things done during the rebellious period that require parents to pay for it<br>Now that I’m older, I understand the difficulties of my parents’ various prohibitions.</p><p>But I can’t help thinking about it<br>I didn’t know what I knew now</p><p>I have imagined that if the self now and the self then<br>I would definitely not be obedient at that time<br>You must be hammered in the face by the iron fist of society to wake up<br>Do something resolutely</p><hr><p>After dealing with the general affairs, one day he will step out of the fairy tale world and enter life</p><blockquote><p>“Good-bye, then, Silas.” Bod held out his hand, as he had when he was a small boy, and Silas took it, in a cold hand the color of old ivory, and shook it gravely.<br>“Good-bye, Nobody Owens.”<br>Bod picked up the little suitcase. He opened the door to let himself out of the crypt, walked back up the gentle slope to the path without looking back.”</p></blockquote><p>I was miserable when I came out, no one gave me away, no goodbye<br>The rent in Beijing was refunded and I bought a one-way ticket<br>All the belongings are packed in three suitcases<br>Take a taxi to the airport at 4 in the morning<br>After finishing the consignment, boarding, and then leaving</p><blockquote><p>without looking back</p></blockquote><p>How I wish I also heard Bod’s auditory hallucinations:</p><blockquote><p>He took a step forward … a voice said, “I am so proud of you, my son.”</p></blockquote>]]></content>

He helped me launched the update server, which is also written in Node.js.

This is the first Clark novel to be read completely.</p><a id="more"></a><h3 id="Translation"><a href="#Translation" class="headerlink" title="Translation"></a>Translation</h3><p>Let me talk about translation</p><p>About two years ago, I had the original version and decided not to read the translation<br>I haven’t read it. Another earlier version met with Rama, so I didn’t post a comparison.<br>As far as this version is concerned, there is no imaginary sense of violation<br>As far as the name is concerned, Rama must be wrong, because the original text contains:</p><blockquote><p>now they were working through the Gindu pantheon. And so 31/439 was christened Rama.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Cover"><a href="#Cover" class="headerlink" title="Cover"></a>Cover</h3><p>And I like this cover<br>When I first got the book, I thought it was a gravitational lens. I was completely misled. I didn’t expect it to be Rama.</p><h3 id="Technology"><a href="#Technology" class="headerlink" title="Technology"></a>Technology</h3><p>On the whole, the only thing that feels wrong is the interstellar spacecraft, and the chimpanzee who does chores<br>Judging from the current level of technology, these things should be more like robots in Interstellar (you see, Rama civilization is also made by Jiangzi)<br>The human physiology described in the book has not improved much compared to now<br>It’s hard to imagine that humans are still like this when they move as far as Pluto (in the book, Pluto is still a planet rather than a dwarf planet).</p><p>You know, I felt like I was going to die when I went to Europe for an 11-hour flight. When I did this kind of interstellar travel, it was not a corpse anymore.</p><p>So if humans don’t iteratively upgrade as described in “Life 3.0”<br>Compared to humans, the humanoid robots in nier automata are more suitable for interstellar travel</p><p>Others are great<br>For example, although Rama’s intelligent life did not show up at the end, it is inferred that it should be similar to humans.<br>The mainstream view of science until now is that carbon-based life is because:</p><ol><li>Macromolecules need carbon and silicon as linkers</li><li>Silicon needs extremely high temperatures to become active</li><li>The carbon in the entire universe is 10 times that of silicon</li></ol><p>Then Rama is the robot, which has specific functions, weak artificial intelligence, and does not need to be conscious</p><h3 id="Rama-people"><a href="#Rama-people" class="headerlink" title="Rama people"></a>Rama people</h3><p>The book is only in Liuli Shrine (I’m sorry I saw the glass and the temple was turned into a shrine ⛩️) That chapter describes the creatures in the crystal, why guess that this is Rama’s advanced intelligent creature?</p><p>Because if you see a 📱 in the universe, you will definitely not think that it was formed naturally, it must be created by some kind of intelligent life</p><h3 id="Nuclear-bomb-from-Mercury"><a href="#Nuclear-bomb-from-Mercury" class="headerlink" title="Nuclear bomb from Mercury"></a>Nuclear bomb from Mercury</h3><p>When I saw it, I was worried about Rama being destroyed.<br>But to me, the Mercury people are not wrong, their speeches also make sense</p><p>If we pause here, treat it as a thought experiment<br>In the end, Rama really occupied the near-solar orbit. There was originally this opportunity to preserve human civilization. As a result, human civilization disappeared because of a person’s hypocrisy. The person who detonated the nuclear bomb was not a hero but a sinner.</p><blockquote><p>Survival is the first need of civilization</p></blockquote><p>In addition, for the human beings who have just stepped out of the solar system, there is no difference from the situation when they stepped out of Africa that year. When facing a dangerous environment again, how can they treat space in the way of modern civilization on Earth?</p><blockquote><p>do not go gentle into that good night</p></blockquote><p>However, from the perspective of Rama, where the sun is only 5 million kilometers behind, it opens the protective cover, absorbs energy, and violates Newton’s third law of position. It is not important whether the nuclear bomb is not important, but it highlights that it is actually a species-level struggle of humans.</p><h3 id="Civilization"><a href="#Civilization" class="headerlink" title="Civilization"></a>Civilization</h3><p>Human evolution has led to little conception of unusual sizes that cross daily levels</p><p>According to the description in the book, it is 50 kilometers long and 20 kilometers in diameter, so the circumference is 62.8 kilometers, so it seems that the entire inner wall area is 3,140 kilometers. What is the concept?</p><ul><li>Three ten thousandths of our country</li><li>Beijing Sixth Ring Road 2,267 km²</li><li>Shanghai 6,340 km²</li><li>Shenzhen 2,050 km²</li><li>Hong Kong 2,754 km²</li></ul><p>Feel it for yourself</p><p>Think about the current population of these cities, so such an area can fully carry the population base required by a human civilization<br>Not to mention the low gravity in the middle of Rama. Now the city skyscrapers are only a few hundred meters away. Rama is 10 kilometers away, which is two orders of magnitude worse. So the actual capacity<br>Not surface area but volume<br>Moreover, Rama should be just one of them, after all</p><blockquote><p>Rama is the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The list of avatars in the Dashavatara varies by region: Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Balarama and Kalki</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Tyrannosauridae giant beast-footed dinosaur, the name means “the tyrant of lizards” in Latin. It was estimated to have reached a length of up to 13 m[1], a hip height of about 4 m[2], and a weight averaging about 9 metric tons…. It had a bite force of nearly 6 metric tons, equivalent to the weight of an elephant[3].</p></blockquote><h3 id="Triceratops"><a href="#Triceratops" class="headerlink" title="Triceratops"></a>Triceratops</h3><blockquote><p>Triceratops (genus name: Triceratops), commonly known as Triceratops, Triceratops, is a genus of Ornithischian Ceratosauridae, a species of plant-eating dinosaur. Triceratops was a medium-sized, quadrupedal dinosaur with a total length of 7 to 10 meters….

However, according to the “out-of-Africa” model, this was not the first species of the genus Homo: the first species of the genus Homo, “Homo sapiens”, evolved at least two million years ago, and Homo sapiens lived in different regions of Africa for a relatively short period of time. “Homo erectus” evolved more than 1.8 million years ago and by 1.5 million years ago had spread throughout the old world.</p></blockquote><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-50.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-52.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-51.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-48.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-49.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><h3 id="Red-giant-star"><a href="#Red-giant-star" class="headerlink" title="Red giant (star)"></a>Red giant (star)</h3><p>Combined with just the huge diamond 💎 , it comes to a question of whether one should buy a diamond ring<br>as is generally known</p><blockquote><p>There are three known isomers of carbon: diamond, graphite and fullerenes. Thermodynamically, diamond is less stable than graphite** can spontaneously transform into graphite**, but the rate of this transformation is negligibly slow at room temperature and pressure, which is why diamond 💎 is stable. Naturally formed diamonds are generally formed in the high temperature and pressure environment of the Earth’s interior, and later brought to the surface by geological tectonic movements such as volcanic eruptions, which is why many diamonds are found near volcanoes. Modern industry can produce diamonds at high temperatures and pressures, known as synthetic diamonds</p></blockquote><p>That’s why diamond rings have no purpose other than to show off by blinding others.<br>Not to mention the fact that the magnifying glass in the sun will evaporate.</p><p>And heavy metals like gold and platinum.</p><blockquote><p>The atomic number of gold is high among the naturally occurring elements in the universe. This heavy element is believed to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis during the collision of two neutron stars,[4] and was present in the dust before the formation of the solar system. Since the Earth was still in a melting state at the time of its formation, almost all of the early Earth’s gold had sunk into the Earth’s core. Thus, much of the gold in the Earth’s crust and mantle now owes its existence to asteroid impact events during the later heavy bombardment period (about 4 billion years ago)<br>Gold has been a popular precious metal for money, hedges, jewelry and works of art for as long as recorded history. In the 1970s, with the end of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the gold standard finally gave way to a legal tender system worldwide. However, because of its rarity, easy melting, processing and minting, unique color, corrosion resistance, difficult to react with other substances and other characteristics, the value of gold does not decline.</p></blockquote><p>lit. one’s superior can clearly see who is stronger</p><p>Of course it’s not a bad deal.<br>Only with a girlfriend to marry, of course.</p><h3 id="gravitational-wave"><a href="#gravitational-wave" class="headerlink" title="gravitational wave"></a>gravitational wave</h3><blockquote><p>A gravitational wave detector (English: gravitational-wave observatory) is a device used in gravitational-wave astronomy to detect gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time created by an accelerating mass. Albert Einstein first introduced the concept of gravitational waves in 1916. [1] By detecting gravitational waves, the theory of general relativity can be verified experimentally. Since the 1960s, several gravitational-wave detectors have been built and commissioned, and there have been advances in detector sensitivity.</p></blockquote><p>And various animal models<br>There’s a giant blue whale outside the museum.</p><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-53.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-54.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-56.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-57.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><h2 id="Ueno-Zoo"><a href="#Ueno-Zoo" class="headerlink" title="Ueno Zoo"></a>Ueno Zoo</h2><p>Every time I’ve been to the zoo, the Tiger House is either under renovation or about to close.<br>Finally, a tiger.<br>Gorilla with turban.<br>I accidentally looked at each other and saw the eyes<br>Instant chill down my spine, thinking of Planet of the Apes.</p><p>Anteaters or?<br>It turns out I’d met a kangaroo before I left for Australia.</p><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-58.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-61.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-62.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-59.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-60.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><p>See the closing, then go back.<br>Passing by the My wife bridge.<br>See that little yellow cloud or ice cream you saw on the Skytree last time?</p><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-64.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-65.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-67.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-68.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-241-69.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><h2 id="Return"><a href="#Return" class="headerlink" title="Return"></a>Return</h2><p>The next day, after checkout, take the Narita Airport Line back to the airport.<br>The lady asked if she was alone when she picked up the tickets.<br>I don’t know why it’s still hurting single people here.</p><p>Then the lady was pleased to inform.<br>We’ve upgraded you to business class.<br>Welcome to JAL Japan Airlines in the future.</p><p>It turns out that the airline company randomly selects some customers for upgrade.</p><p>Lucky</p><p>This upgrade is limited to business class on the plane.<br>Unlike ANA, which paid for itself before.<br>Access to first class lounge with shower room</p><hr><p>Of course, business class is as comfortable as ever.<br>I slept on the plane.<br>And that was the end of a 10-day trip to Japan.</p>]]></content>

Tokyo, from April 1998 to May 1999 in commemoration of “The French year in Japan”.[3] Because of its popularity, in 2000 a replica of the French Statue of Liberty was erected at the same place. Also in Japan, a small Statue of Liberty is in the Amerika-mura (American Village) shopping district in Osaka, Japan. Another replica is in Oirase[71] near the town of Shimoda south of Misawa in Aomori Prefecture, where the United States has an 8,000-person U.S. Air Force base. A replica of the Statue of Liberty in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, was damaged by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[72] There is also a replica in Oyabe, Toyama.[73]</p></blockquote><p>That’s it</p><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-38.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-40.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-39.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><h2 id="Gundam"><a href="#Gundam" class="headerlink" title="Gundam"></a>Gundam</h2><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-42.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><p>Wow</p><p>Remember to watch Gundam Seed or borrow a disc from a classmate 👨‍🎓 when I was in high school 💽 secretly watch at home<br>A few years ago, there was a remake, but I haven’t seen it before, after all<br>My youth is over</p><p>I can’t remember the plot or something now<br>Just remember Kira’s freedom Gundam<br>Single machine breaks through the atmosphere<br>Cut a lot of sticks<br>Then flew away</p><p>But this one in front of Uniqlo<br>See halo and corner<br>This should be a unicorn 🦄️<br>Fortunately, I watched the UC movie later, Laplace’s undead or something, otherwise I don’t know it again</p><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-43.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-44.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-41.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><p>There are Garage Kit in the shop next to it</p><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-45.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-240-46.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div>]]></content>

detailed insight into the everyday life of its inhabitants, although much of the evidence was lost in the early excavations. It was a wealthy town, enjoying many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and works of art which were the main attractions for the early excavators. Organic remains, including wooden objects and human bodies, were entombed in the ash and decayed leaving voids which archaeologists found could be used as moulds to make plaster casts of unique and often gruesome figures in their final moments of life. The numerous graffiti carved on the walls and inside rooms provide a wealth of examples of the largely lost Vulgar Latin spoken colloquially at the time, contrasting with the formal language of the classical writers.<br>Pompeii is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Italy, with approximately 2.5 million visitors annually.</p></blockquote><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-17.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-18.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-19.jpg" alt=""></div></div><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-22.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-24.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><h2 id="Eruption-of-Mount-Vesuvius-in-79-AD"><a href="#Eruption-of-Mount-Vesuvius-in-79-AD" class="headerlink" title="Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD"></a>Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD</h2><blockquote><p>Around 1:00 PM, Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, wholly or partly knocking down all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating the remaining population and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.<br>Pliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:<br>Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night… it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Great-Theatre-of-Pompeii"><a href="#Great-Theatre-of-Pompeii" class="headerlink" title="Great Theatre of Pompeii"></a>Great Theatre of Pompeii</h3><blockquote><p>The theatre area of Pompeii is located in the southwest region of the city. There are three main buildings that make up this area: the Large Theatre, the Odeon (small theatre), and the Quadriporticum. This served as an entertainment and meeting center of the city.<br>The Large Theatre was built into a natural hill in the second century BC. This theatre sat roughly 5,000 spectators and is one of the original permanent stone theatres to stand in Rome.<br>The theatre has been used for concerts, operas, and theatre in modern times. In 2008, a restoration effort began to allow for further theatrical and musical performances. Upon reopening, productions of Puccini’s La boheme and Bizet’s Carmen took place in 2014.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-27.jpg" alt=""></p><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-26.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-29.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><p>As far as the black clouds of the volcano. 🌋<br>It’s hard to imagine lava covering this area.</p><h3 id="Amphitheatre-of-Pompeii"><a href="#Amphitheatre-of-Pompeii" class="headerlink" title="Amphitheatre of Pompeii"></a>Amphitheatre of Pompeii</h3><blockquote><p>Built around 70 BC, the current amphitheatre is the earliest Roman amphitheatre known to have been built of stone; previously, they had been built out of wood.<br>Aside from being a historical landmark and an object of archaeological study, the amphitheatre has been used for concerts and other public events in modern times.</p></blockquote><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-30.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-28.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/ita-0-0-32.jpg" alt=""></p><h2 id="Mount-Vesuvius"><a href="#Mount-Vesuvius" class="headerlink" title="Mount Vesuvius"></a>Mount Vesuvius</h2><blockquote><p>It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis and Stabiae, as well as several other settlements. ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy released by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>Vesuvius has erupted many times since, and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected by an eruption, with 600,000 in the danger zone, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world, as well as its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the Plinian type.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Vesuvius was formed as a result of the collision of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and lowered the melting point of the upper mantle enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward.

There is access by road to within 200 metres (660 ft) of the summit (measured vertically), but thereafter access is on foot only.

Skytree"></a>Tokyo Skytree</h2><p>It’s not just a tower for heights and attractions, it’s a radio station.</p><blockquote><p>The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kantō region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012<br>Tokyo Skytree also resembles a 5-storey pagoda from historical Japan.[11] The base of the tower has a structure similar to a tripod; from a height of about 350 m (1,150 ft) and above, the tower’s structure is cylindrical to offer panoramic views of the river and the city.[12] There are observatories at 350 m (1,150 ft), with a capacity of up to 2,000 people, and 450 m (1,480 ft), with a capacity of 900 people.[13] The upper observatory features a spiral, glass-covered skywalk in which visitors ascend the last 5 meters to the highest point at the upper platform. A section of glass flooring gives visitors a direct downward view of the streets below.[<br>The tower has seismic proofing, including a central shaft made of reinforced concrete. The main internal pillar is attached to the outer tower structure for the first 125 meters (410 ft) above ground. From there until 375 meters (1,230 ft) the pillar is attached to the tower frame with oil dampers, which act as cushions during an earthquake. Additional resilience is achieved through an “added mass control mechanism” (or tuned mass damper) – a damping system which, in the event of an earthquake, moves out of step with the building’s structure, to keep the center of gravity as central as possible to the tower’s base.[15] According to the designers, the dampers can absorb 50 percent of the energy from an earthquake.</p></blockquote><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-0-1-38.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-0-1-58.jpg" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/japan-0-1-60.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div><p>Fear of heights.<br>I don’t know if I’m hallucinating.<br>Feel the tower swaying slightly.</p><p>They say they’re not afraid.<br>shiver with fear<br>Go up and keep your body close to the inside.<br>Plucked up the courage to look out the glass.</p><p>The glass floor at the highest point is fine.

When we were kid, we learned our mother tongue natural without any pain.</p><p>So when I was in my poor primary school, I never remember a word.</p><a id="more"></a><p>In fact, the truth is I can’t remember words. Believe it or not, no matter how hard I tried, I just can’t remember them. Each time it’s my row’s turn to write words on blackboard, I had to watch left and right carefully and copied each character one by one.</p><p>As a teenager at that time, I’m curious that why they can do it. It must be the method incompatible with my brain.</p><p>Fortunately, I read another method on a gramma book that a former top scorer announced that she did not remember words either. All she was doing is repeat NCE 100+ times loudly.</p><p>Hum, that’s great, so I tried it and this method helps me a lot, for it let me got a fair score in college entrance examination and passed the CET6 in university, even I did know what I’m reading sometimes.</p><p>Until IELTS, all the English tests early were merely a joke.</p><p>And there is another blind spot I realised recently, exam is exam, one should get the point and leave ASAP.</p><p>Before that, I firmly believed that as long as my true level raise, I will be capable of the exam with no extra effort like do the test paper everyday.</p><p>But in fact, this required a very high quality far more than the exam required, this is an endless road.</p><p>14 years passed after first time I got to know English, I feel I just make one little step after I communicated with the resident a few month ago.</p><p>Now I know the language is more like an instinct of mankind, when baby grow up, the neurone cells will be cleaned by our brain cause there is no use for our ancestors to learn another language when they were kids, according to evolutionary psychology.</p><p>But we are in modern world, as far as I know, there is only two methods which sound reasonable, and more importantly, economic.</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18868451?from_search=true">把你的英语用起来</a></li><li>赖世雄美语音标</li><li>ESLPOD</li><li>American Accent Training</li><li>Read at least 10 original edition books per year</li><li><a href="http://www.geekonomics10000.com/870">一点实用主义的学英语心得</a></li><li>Learn 600 GRE words per day</li><li>Repeat it by Ebbinghaus forgetting curve</li><li>Intensive reading</li><li>Past exam paper</li></ol><p>Now you see, ironically No. 2 kicks me to origin: I have to remember words!</p><p>But at least one things is different this time, I choose it by my free will.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">Polyphasic sleep</a> when the first time I heard about it. It’s almost 2 years after that time.</p><a id="more"></a><p>It’s not a rigorous Polyphasic sleep, for I’m using 6 hour major sleep episode and three 30-minute power naps. And I use hypnosis when I have naps at the same time.</p><p>It’s really good. Usually I’ll wake up at 6 in the morning and do tons of work, then I feel tired and have the first nap at 10 or 11 and wake up with many Chinese people. I’ll have the second nap after lunch, the third when I went home.</p><p>This hack method gives me an illusion that daytime is stretched, because every time I wake up from a nap, I feel it’s totally a new day.</p><p>But I found a side effect recently, which is the malaise was also magnified. Especially I’m in anxiety these days.</p><p>It’s not polyphasic sleep’s fault, I think, time to read Burns David’s <em>When Panic Attacks</em>.</p>]]></content>

These different arguments confused me at that time. As I continues to read, the concept of observer appeared in my eyes.</p><p>For the first time I heard about <em>observer</em> was in my college. I read that word from <em>The dark forest</em>. It’s more fascinating after I read one book about quantum mechanics.</p><p>There is also an idea about observer in psychology.

When I finished <em>Think on These Things</em> one year later, I try to build an observer about myself.<br>Because usually things will be more clear when you saw others doing it. The weakness and blind spot is apparent and evident, you will find better solution.</p><p>It is glad that I achieved this goal in my gap year, there was two versions of me, one acting, one watching.<br>I do not think the observer equals to superego, but it is clearly a guardian of ego.</p><p>But when I worked to Beijing one year and a half ago, all the works I builded ruined. The observer of me was gone. I had some new bed habits like watch the watch frequently which reveal my anxious and nervous.</p><p>When I do something wrong, I felt exhausted. Luckily I had a long vacation that I went to my parent’s home. Although that town is not an outfield, but at least it detach me from the supercity. Also, I have some deep talks about my dreams with my parents. They feels helpless because our poor family and the rising hotel rates, and they cannot understand why I’m acting so odd.</p><p>After 10 days later my vacation due, I felt relief.</p>]]></content>

The <strong>right</strong> measures your own justice and can you responsible for your own actions. But when you joined to a big company, your manager concerned is that can you doing things right. That is why startup companies have more energy.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Humans are by nature social animals, if a group has less than 140 people, it can managed by itself. Because everyone knows what others doing, they can easily have a common points of view about someone, there is no place for cribbers. But when the group become bigger, fog and shadow are appear, your ability and capability largely depend on your manager, it’s no longer based on your real contributions.</p><p>Most companies have hundreds of employees, that’s why office politics so common in big companies. How to dealing with office politics is in primary. After all, it related to your <strong>salary and promotion</strong>. If you want that, the best way is to become a politician, everyone knows what’s going on, but no one point out, just like <em>The Emperor’s New Clothes</em>. the risk is you may lose yourself.</p><p>That’s why an excellent startup company so attracting, but there always will be one day, the company become big as for it’s excellent. More and more strangers are joined, not everyone are friendly. if you still be yourself, and careless about politics, that may cause inappropriate, gossip will be everywhere, and when the new year come, you have no promotion without rhyme or reason.</p><p>The neutral way was working like an android, don’t share any of your emotions and feelings, that will makes your colleagues feels some kind of professional. The disadvantage is that there is no chance you will be consider as a friend. but as for the company already changed ( not a startup any more ), it’s more acceptable than the previous one.</p>]]></content>

It is an <strong>investment</strong>.</p><p>You may lose that 45 minutes. But you’ll gain so much more. It’s such a good investment. Your memory actually gets better when you exercise. So you’ll get more buck for the bank in terms of time you study; your <strong>creativity and concentration</strong> levels go up</p><p>Whether you have ADD or not, especially if you have.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Relationship"><a href="#Relationship" class="headerlink" title="Relationship"></a>Relationship</h2><blockquote><p>People stay together out of a sense of duty, out of habit, because they think this is their lot in life.</p><p>A lack of alternative</p><p>“do unto others what you would unto yourself.”</p><p>“do not do unto yourself what you would not do unto others.”</p></blockquote><h2 id="Love"><a href="#Love" class="headerlink" title="Love"></a>Love</h2><blockquote><p>“Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain.”</p><p>But while perfect love doesn’t exist, <strong>true love dose</strong>. True love exists between imperfect humans.</p><p>I will find that right person. I don’t believe that. It’s simply not true. It’s not the matter of faith.</p><p>So what makes relationship unique? It’s not finding that one right person. Once again it’s cultivating that one chosen relationship. It’s by virtue of working together, of being together, of spending time together, of dedicating one another. That’s how we create the one chosen relationship.

So, I began to wonder why and try to return.</p><p>For I went to the gopher China in April, and meet with one IT crop. CTO, and talk to him that maybe I’m in a bottleneck period.</p><p>But it’s September now, the summer ends, I’ve been in Beijing for a most one year, and still trapping in this mass state.</p><p>I tried to figure out</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="The-model"><a href="#The-model" class="headerlink" title="The model"></a>The model</h2><p>First, the style of living (surviving in deed) was not like Hangzhou, when I was in Hangzhou, I can rent a flat which company was nearby that I can walk to work, and I have my own bathroom in my room so one bother me. But in Beijing, if I still use the same model, I have to live in an old flat, which the building was even old than me! even worse, I have to live with neighbors, share the bathroom kitchen and all other things. So you have to pray for your neighbors are good.<br>For me, as an internal person, I just want to live alone.</p><p>Once I resize this cause, I rent a new flat immediately and I’ll move in the end of this month, but one year past and never came back.</p><h2 id="English"><a href="#English" class="headerlink" title="English"></a>English</h2><p>I read at least 10 books each month before, but for I narrowed to English edition recent months, the numbers dropped so fiercely that I hardly finished a book in one month.</p><p>No books makes me feel sick, and no input, no output. That’s an important reason that I stopped posting blog and The little master series. Needless to say I forced myself all new blogs have to write in English.</p><h2 id="Procrastination"><a href="#Procrastination" class="headerlink" title="Procrastination"></a>Procrastination</h2><p>It seems a universal problem. But after I read too much GTDs and found the healthy circle based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">polyphasic sleep</a>. I can do 16+ <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/4198078/">pomodoroes</a> one day.<br>After I return to work in company, I just do what I want do, and I thought I was still efficient.</p><p>Even though I already outsource apply instead DIY, preparing IELTS and working hard still a big challenge to me, not only because I unknown the starting date but also my co-workers ungelivable. I have to write almost 70% codes in the main project and even to rewrote some functions off his part. I want to figure out one way to manage our new team( for right now I like a TL assistant)</p><p>So, all the apps that I used were return, and I feels it really improve my situation.</p><h2 id="Slack"><a href="#Slack" class="headerlink" title="Slack"></a>Slack</h2><p>It’s not that Slack, although I have to write some code according to it’s API in future for our CI.</p><p>I found something I runaround but I have to face it again in future with more effort. like hope my co-workers write more, read the translate version books, excise, etc.</p><p>So, I dared not hope anymore.</p><hr><p>That’s all, winter is coming.</p>]]></content>

Everytime I had something to ask him, he explained it in the deepest level, and inspired me by rhetorical questions patiently. But at the same time, I found thousands and thousands Copy &amp; Paste lines of code in the project. Yes, I counted it by using <a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/">CLOC</a>, and found that it’s almost 20 thousands lines in total.</p><p>As Objective-C is a excessively long and prolix programming language( which means that your have to write dozens of code to implement the same function which may only a line in Ruby 😫 ), it’s rational for the count of this project. But Copy &amp; Paste should always avoided, worse I saw global variables and magic numbers are everywhere.😰</p><p>It’s odd, isn’t it? If a 10 years experienced programer who can deal with pointer easily and knows computer systems deeply, why didn’t he pay any attention to the code styles. After all, we need to prepare for adding new members in the team and new features at any time.</p><p>He said that most of code was written by him, it’s quick to fix bugs. However, he went to a start company of his friend in next month. So he just left, and also, the anfractuosity code.😭😭😭</p><p>to be continued…</p>]]></content>

Do that, and the next day’s work goes surprisingly smoothly. I think Ernest Hemingway did something like that. To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for longCterm projects.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’m the type of person who doesn’t find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I ran a bar, so I learned the importance of being with others and the obvious point that we can’t survive on our own.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The clouds are mere guests in the sky that pass away and vanish, leaving behind the sky.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>it’s precisely because people are different from others that they’re able to create their own independent selves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I had to give it everything I had. If I failed, I could accept that. But I knew that if I did things halfheartedly and they didn’t work out, I’d always have regrets.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I only began to enjoy studying after I got through the educational system and became a soCcalled member of society.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We’d closed the club, so we also decided that from now on we’d meet with only the people we wanted to see and, as much as possible, get by not seeing those we didn’t. We felt that, for a time at least, we could allow ourselves this modest indulgence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was my real schooling. But you can’t keep up that kind of life forever. Just as with school, you enter it, learn something, and then it’s time to leave.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’m struck by how, except when you’re young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don’t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you’ll lack focus and your life will be out of balance</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In other words, you can’t please everybody</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Life just isn’t fair, is how it used to strike me. Some people can work their butts off and never get what they’re aiming for, while others can get it without any effort at all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It suits me. Or at least because I don’t find it all that painful.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The most important thing we ever learn at school is the fact that the most important things can’t be learned at school</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>while they’re getting by on these, they may actually discover real, hidden talent within them</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’ve always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I’m wrong, but I won’t change.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My own individual, stubborn, uncooperative, often selfCcentered nature that still doubts itself—that, when troubles occur, tries to find something funny, or something nearly funny, about the situation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This takes time, of course, but sometimes taking time is actually a shortcut.</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Android 尚未出现</p><blockquote><p>最好把这五种语言（Python、Java、C/C++、Perl 和 LISP）都学了。它们不只是最重要的黑客语言，还代表了截然不同的编程方法，每一种都会让你受益匪浅</p></blockquote><p>重复造轮子</p><blockquote><p>创造性头脑是无比珍贵的有限资源，它们不应浪费在重新发明轮子这种事上，尤其是还有这么多迷人的新问题在那里等着的时候</p></blockquote><p>GUI</p><blockquote><p>问题主要出在人机工程学设计和界面心理学上，黑客在这些方面从来就很弱。黑客在为其他黑客设计接口时做得很好，但他们往往不善于为另外 95%人群的思维过程建模</p></blockquote><p>下面是书摘，附录很有意思</p><hr><h2 id="2-大教堂与集市"><a href="#2-大教堂与集市" class="headerlink" title="2. 大教堂与集市"></a>2. 大教堂与集市</h2><ol><li>好的软件作品，往往源自于开发者的个人需要</li><li>优秀的程序员知道写什么，卓越的程序员知道改写（和重用）什么</li><li>“计划好扔掉一个吧，迟早你会这么做的。”（Fred Brooks，《人月神话》第 11 章）</li><li>如果你有正确的态度，有趣的事情自然会找到你。</li><li>当你对一个程序不再感兴趣时，你最后的责任就是把它交给一个可以胜任的接棒者</li><li>把你的用户当成开发合作者对待，如果想让代码质量快速提升并有效排错，这是最省心的途径。</li><li>早发布，常发布，倾听用户的反馈。</li><li>如果有足够多的 beta 测试者和合作开发者，几乎所有问题都会很快显现，然后自然有人会把它解决。</li></ol><ul><li>Linus 定律道出了大教堂模式和集市模式最关键的区别：在大教堂建筑者看来，bug 是棘手的、难以发现的、隐藏在深处的，要经过几个人数月的全心投入和仔细检查，才能有点信心说已经剔除了所有错误。而发布间隔越长，倘若等待已久的发布版本并不完美，人们的失望就越发不可避免。</li><li>对集市模式而言则完全不同，在上千名合作开发者热切钻研每个新发布版本的情况下，你可以假定 bug 是浅显易找的，或者至少可以很快变得浅显易找。所以你会频繁发布以获取更多的修正，其副作用是良性的：即便发布中有些小问题，你也不会损失太多。</li></ul><ol start="9"><li>聪明的数据结构配上愚笨的代码，远比反过来要好得多。</li><li>如果你把 beta 测试者当做最珍贵的资源对待，他们就会成为你最珍贵的资源</li><li>仅次于拥有好主意的是，识别来自用户的好主意，有时后者会更好</li><li>通常，那些最有突破性和最有创新力的解决方案来自于你认识到你对问题的基本观念是错的。</li><li>“设计上的完美不是没有东西可以再加，而是没有东西可以再减。”</li><li>任何工具都应具备预期内的功能，但一个伟大的工具能给你带来预期外的功能。</li><li>写网关类软件时，尽可能不要干扰数据流，而且绝不要扔掉信息，除非接收方强迫你这么做</li><li>当你的语言还远不是图灵完备（Turing-complete）的时候，语法糖会让你受益良多。</li><li>系统的安全性只取决于它所拥有的秘密。谨防虚假的秘密。</li><li>想要解决一个有趣的问题，先去找一个让你感兴趣的问题。</li><li>如果开发协调者有一个至少像 Internet 这样好的沟通媒介，并且知道如何不靠强制来领导，那么多人合作必然强于单兵作战</li></ol><ul><li>如果你在工作过程中感到恐惧和厌恶（即便你以自嘲的形式来表达——比如悬挂呆伯特玩偶），就应该意识到过程已经出了问题。快乐、幽默和玩兴是真正的资产</li><li>玩”是创造性活动中最具经济效能的工作模式。</li></ul><h2 id="3-开垦心智层"><a href="#3-开垦心智层" class="headerlink" title="3. 开垦心智层"></a>3. 开垦心智层</h2><ul><li>在礼物文化中，社会地位并不取决于你控制了什么，而是你给予了什么</li></ul><ol><li>如果它不能像我所预期的那样工作，那就不是好的——不管它多么聪明和有原创性。</li><li>在心智层的拓展性工作要比在某功能域内（对现有作品）的重复性工作好。</li><li>能进入主要发行版的作品比不能进入的好。在所有主要发行版中都包含的作品最令人尊敬。</li><li>“使用”是最真实的赞美，类别杀手比同类竞争者好。</li><li>相比那些只挑有趣和简单工作的人，长期致力于艰苦和乏味工作（如调试、写文档）的人更令人钦佩。</li><li>重要的功能扩展比低层次的修补好。</li></ol><h2 id="4-魔法锅"><a href="#4-魔法锅" class="headerlink" title="4. 魔法锅"></a>4. 魔法锅</h2><ol><li>可靠性/稳定性/可扩展性非常重要。</li><li>除了独立的同行评审，没有其他便捷易行的方法验证设计和实现的正确性。</li><li>该软件对客户的业务非常关键。</li><li>该软件创建或运转一个公共计算或通信基础架构。</li><li>关键方法（或能实现同等功能的方法）属于公共知识</li></ol><h2 id="5-黑客的反击"><a href="#5-黑客的反击" class="headerlink" title="5. 黑客的反击"></a>5. 黑客的反击</h2><ul><li>理论和语言的缺乏在两个方面对我们不利：一是我们不能系统性地思考如何改进我们的方法，二是我们难以向别人解释和推销我们的方法</li></ul><h2 id="附录-A：如何成为一名黑客"><a href="#附录-A：如何成为一名黑客" class="headerlink" title="附录 A：如何成为一名黑客"></a>附录 A：如何成为一名黑客</h2><h3 id="黑客搞建设，骇客搞破坏"><a href="#黑客搞建设，骇客搞破坏" class="headerlink" title="黑客搞建设，骇客搞破坏"></a>黑客搞建设，骇客搞破坏</h3><h3 id="黑客的态度"><a href="#黑客的态度" class="headerlink" title="黑客的态度"></a>黑客的态度</h3><ol><li>这个世界充满了迷人的问题等待人们去解决。</li><li>不要解决一个问题两次。</li><li>无聊和乏味是有害的</li><li>自由是好事</li><li>态度不能代替能力。</li></ol><h3 id="黑客的基本技能"><a href="#黑客的基本技能" class="headerlink" title="黑客的基本技能"></a>黑客的基本技能</h3><ol><li>学习编程</li></ol><ul><li>想要获得将知识转化为技能的思维模式，只能通过实践和跟随大师。做法就是读代码和写代码</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>找一个开源 UNIX，学习使用和运行它。</li><li>学习如何使用 WWW 和写 HTML。</li></ol><h3 id="地位之于黑客文化"><a href="#地位之于黑客文化" class="headerlink" title="地位之于黑客文化"></a>地位之于黑客文化</h3><ol><li>写开源软件。</li><li>协助测试和调试开源软件</li><li>发布有用的信息。</li><li>帮助做一些基础工作。</li><li>服务黑客文化自身。</li></ol><h3 id="格调问题"><a href="#格调问题" class="headerlink" title="格调问题"></a>格调问题</h3><ul><li><p>学习很好地使用你的母语写作。尽管有一种陈旧的看法认为程序员写作不行，但很多黑客（包括我所知道的那些最优秀的黑客们）写得一手好文章，而且其数量多得让人吃惊。</p></li><li><p>阅读科幻小说，参加科幻小说集会（这是认识黑客和潜在黑客的好方法）。</p></li><li><p>研习禅修，并且/或者学习武术。（心智训练似乎在很多重要方面都是类似的。）</p></li><li><p>培养起对音乐的鉴赏力。学会欣赏一些独特类型的音乐。学习很好地演奏乐器，或者学习如何唱歌。</p></li><li><p>培养出你对双关语和俏皮话的欣赏能力。</p><p>但这些事与左右脑技能的结合有关，这可能是问题的关键所在（黑客不仅需要有很强的逻辑推理能力，而且要能够很快从问题的具体逻辑中跳脱出来）</p></li></ul><h3 id="不要"><a href="#不要" class="headerlink" title="不要"></a>不要</h3><ul><li>不要使用愚蠢、浮夸的用户名或昵称。</li><li>不要卷入 Usenet（或其他任何地方）的网络骂战。</li><li>不要自称为“电脑朋克”，也不要浪费时间交往那些自称电脑朋克的人。</li><li>不要让你的贴子或 email 充满错误的拼写和糟糕的语法。</li></ul><p>最后：<br><strong>“只有其他黑客认为你是黑客时，你才是黑客”</strong><br>所表达出来的价值观，类似于中世纪欧洲骑士时代精英团体所宣称的理想（通常总是无法实现），这些社会精英有足够的财力超脱于所处的稀缺经济。像人们期望的那样，一个有抱负的骑士为正义而战，他追求荣誉而非获取钱财，他站在弱势和受压迫者一边，不断寻求机会挑战自己英勇才能的极限。也正因如此，他会认为自己（并被别人认为）是人中翘楚——前提是他的能力和品行已获得其他骑士的承认和正式认可。在亚瑟王传奇（Arthurian tales）和武功歌（chansons de geste）所颂扬的骑士精神中，我们看到了理想主义、对自我的不断挑战和对地位的追求，这与当今激励黑客的要素是类似的。</p>]]></content>

I’m speechless.</p><p>Graduating and choosing a job so I can study.<br>I just got a job and every call makes me take a civil service exam (what about those who say they need to call from time to time and be in touch often, what about this situation?)<br>Gap Year (didn’t ask my parents for a penny) and still dislikes me every day.</p><p>Anyway, it just feels like you’re their property, and LZ brought you into the world, so you don’t do what I say?<br>Fuck! You’ve grown up and you’re not going to listen to me, are you? You can’t stand it!</p><a id="more"></a><p>Then begins, to dictate to you, in a vain attempt to tamper with your life:</p><ol><li>Use of force and brainwashing (it’s been going on since I was a kid, now I just have to flip the switch)<br>Move out of the mojo, “If the ruler wants the minister to die, the minister has to die. If the father wants the son to die, the son has to die.”<br>Take out of context “If parents are present, they will not travel far” (travel must be done)<br>of all virtues filial piety is the most important<br>……</li></ol><p>PS: Did they watch 1984? I’m so shallow.</p><p>But you’ve probably been showered with Western ideas of equality, read about it.<br>Rousseau’s “On the Origin of Human Inequality,” Russell’s “History of Western Philosophy,” Thoreau’s “Walden Lake” and a series of other masterpieces<br>He’s moving towards independence of thought. He doesn’t give a shit about Confucius and Mencius.</p><p>Never mind.</p><ol start="2"><li>Kidnapping you with material things.<br>Common: full payment, down payment, job placement, etc.</li></ol><p>According to Influence, give the other person the benefit of the doubt and they don’t feel indebted to you so they can get more out of it<br>In other words, “I’ll take your word for it, but I’ll take your hand for it.”</p><p>But you may have read Krishnamurti’s “What You Mustn’t Expect in Life”, Lao Tzu’s “Tao Te Ching”, “The Power of the Present Moment” in your weak years.<br>Knowing that life should liberate itself and seek inner peace.<br>LZ can stand on his own two feet, but he’s still alive and well.</p><p>I’m financially independent now, so I can’t do anything to you.</p><p>That’s okay. Here’s more.</p><ol start="3"><li>the trick of inflicting injury on oneself<br>Even if you’re a bull shit.<br>No one can be heartless. After all, blood is thicker than water.<br>They tried to kidnap you with their affection.<br>“This life is for you” and “Don’t blame your parents, they’ve given you the best.”</li></ol><p>I’ll be damned. Do you think “best” is what I want?</p><p>“We’re doing this for you, are you doing me justice?”<br>O__O”…<br>Where did you get this sourpuss? (This deeply sacrificial parent was mentioned in The Road Less Traveled, awkward)</p><p>“We’re your parents, of course we care about you.”<br>Come on, it’s a control freak thing. It’s not a concern.<br>Caring for someone in that tone?</p><p>PS: Lovers have this problem with each other too</p><hr><p>That’s a bit harsh, isn’t it?<br>In fact, most of the parents’ generation (they were once young too, okay?) became victims of a general lack of education<br>Black-and-white thinking, people following the crowd, no ability to think for themselves</p><p>It causes them to be unaware of the inappropriateness of their thoughts, ideas, attitudes, and tone of voice<br>It’s useless to ignore the objective facts, and to insist that you are right. After all, you eat more salt than a child eats rice, and it’s like “what I say is the truth of the universe”.</p><p>As a kid, it’s pretty sad to see them use that tone of voice, knowing it’s not them<br>The best way (that I can think of right now) is probably just to pander and do some “nice lies” to cheer them up.<br>But when it comes to something big, the paper can’t hold the fire, and conflict is inevitable.</p><p>Due to age, it is almost impossible for the elderly to be exposed to new ideas, and it is no longer realistic to ask the older generation to change<br>But we can move on to the next generation - I don’t know if you realize that our generation is going to be parents too.</p><p>So we can ask questions like, “How to communicate with my parents”, “How to keep my parents from getting angry”, “What is the best way to make myself think that my parents’ advice is right”, “How to be an obedient child”, “How to convince them that I want to go for civil service/graduate/doctoral/ post-graduate exams or stay in my hometown if my parents don’t want me to.”</p><p>And then you give them a sidelong reminder that they’re in the know.</p>]]></content>

的 GUI 与 worker 线程，最终根据用户输入的关键字，实现像 google 关键字查找那样简单的搜索，然后瞬间返回所有匹配的文件/文件夹以及递归得到该文件/文件夹的系统路径。</p></blockquote><p><strong>关键词</strong>：<strong>NTFS, 快速，关键词，查找，文件路径</strong></p><h2 id="1-引言"><a href="#1-引言" class="headerlink" title="1 引言"></a>1 引言</h2><p>Windows 的目录结构，在 NTFS 卷中，文件在目录中以<br>B+树的形式排列，在目录中查找文件时按<br>B+树的搜索方法先搜索根节点(从根目录开始)，然后按要找的文件名与根节点中的子节点对应的文件名相比较以确定在哪个子节点对应的存储区中搜索，然后以子节点为当前的根节点再搜索，直到找到文件为止。^[1]^</p><p>微软系统提供的搜索虽然可以搜索文本内容，但速度十分不理想。大多数情况下，我们只想知道文件存放在电脑的哪个文件夹下，而本程序很好的解决了这一点。</p><h2

NTFS</h3><p>NTFS(New Technology File System)是 Windows<br>NT 以及之后的 Windows 的标准文件系统。NTFS 取代了文件分配表（FAT）文件系统，为 Microsoft 的 Windows 系列操作系统提供文件系统。NTFS 对 FAT 和 HPFS（高性能文件系统）作了若干改进，例如，支持元数据，并且使用了高级数据结构，以便于改善性能、可靠性和磁盘空间利用率。^[2]^</p><h3 id="2-2-现状"><a href="#2-2-现状" class="headerlink" title="2.2 现状"></a>2.2 现状</h3><p>随着以 NT 为内核的 Windows<br>2000/XP 的普及，很多个人用户开始用到了 NTFS。NTFS 也是以簇为单位来存储数据文件，但 NTFS 中簇的大小并不依赖于磁盘或分区大小。簇尺寸缩小不但降低了磁盘空间的浪费，还减少了产生磁盘碎片的可能。NTFS 支持文件加密管理功能，可为用户提供更高层次的安全保证。^[3]^</p><h2 id="3-准备"><a href="#3-准备" class="headerlink" title="3 准备"></a>3 准备</h2><h3 id="3-1-设计思路"><a href="#3-1-设计思路" class="headerlink" title="3.1 设计思路"></a>3.1 设计思路</h3><p>读取磁盘全部文件名称作为数据，根据用户输入关键字，在数据中匹配。正确的连同路径一起返回给用户，以方便的打开文件。</p><p>具体设计思路如图 3-1 所示。</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeiHao0/BlogAssets/assets/QSearch_00.jpg" alt="图 3-1 设计思路"></p><p>哈希表最大的优点，就是把数据的存储和查找消耗的时间大大降低，几乎可以看成是常数时间；而代价仅仅是消耗比较多的内存。然而在当前可利用内存越来越多的情况下，用空间换时间的做法是值得的。另外，编码比较容易也是它的特点之一。</p><h3 id="3-2-什么是-USN"><a href="#3-2-什么是-USN" class="headerlink" title="3.2 什么是 USN"></a>3.2 什么是 USN</h3><p>程序的重中之重是读取 USN。</p><p>USN 是 Update Service Number Journal or Change<br>Journal 的缩写，对 NTFS 卷里所修改过的信息进行相关记录的功能，可以在分区中设置监视更改的文件和目录的数量，记录下监视对象修改时间和修改内容。</p><p>当启用 USN 日志时，对于每一个 NTFS 卷，当有添加、删除和修改文件的信息时，NTFS 都使用 USN 日志记录下来，并储存为<br>USN_RECORD 的格式。</p><h3 id="3-3-为什么快速"><a href="#3-3-为什么快速" class="headerlink" title="3.3 为什么快速"></a>3.3 为什么快速</h3><p>USN 日志相当于 WORD 目录，提供了索引，当然文章内容发生变化的时候，USN 日志会记录下来何时做了修改，但它并不记录里面具体修改了什么东西，所以索引文件很小。而当你想查找文章具体的段落时，你就不用狂转鼠标滚轮，直接看目录即可，定位也只需要按住 ctrl+鼠标单击。</p><p>同理，当你想查找某一篇文件时，可以直接通过查找 USN 日志（也就是建立的索引）就知道这个文件是否存在。</p><p>PS：windows 虽然不是“一切皆是文件”（Unix/Linux<br>的基本哲学之一），但文件夹也是以文件的形式存在，所以也可以通过 USN 来查找位置。</p><h3 id="3-4-环境"><a href="#3-4-环境" class="headerlink" title="3.4 环境"></a>3.4 环境</h3><p>由于 NTFS 格式本来就是微软的专利，所以提供了一系列的 API 函数，供我们方便的访问。</p><p>作为古老但是经典的 Visual C++ 6.0<br>编程工具，但那时尚未有 NTFS 格式，所以选择了 VC2005 作为集成开发环境，而且只能运行在 2000 以后的 windows 系统。</p><h2 id="4-程序的实现"><a href="#4-程序的实现" class="headerlink" title="4 程序的实现"></a>4

test.2012-5-14.txt，经常是输入“test<br>.txt”，所以需要模糊查找。由于在 console 下，以&lt;filename,<br>pfrn&gt;创建哈希表，如果要实现模糊查找，哈希表变没有必要，可以直接利用容器 vector。</p><p>根据实际情况，不需要很严格的通配符，”* ？”<br>即可解决大部分查找问题，加上用户一般可能不知道通配符的使用，更不用说正则表达式。所以以“空格”<br>代替 “* ？”，实现 百度<br>google 那样以空格隔开关键字的查找方式，是个很好的解决办法。****</p><h4 id="4-5-2-大小写、顺序"><a href="#4-5-2-大小写、顺序" class="headerlink" title="4.5.2
