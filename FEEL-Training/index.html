    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 id="first-day"><a href="#first-day" class="headerlink" title="first day"></a>first day</h2><p>On the first day of the training, executives took turns to introduce them.<br>First time I met a real CEO COO CTO CFO<br>It’s rather embarrassing to have lunch at noon, and it looks like a private room reserved for executives. As a result, all the executives went back, and a few people went in. Fortunately, some colleagues came one after another.<br>After signing the contract in the afternoon, I went to my place.<br>Next to the window, there is a big gap between the curtains. The scorching sun spreads on my LCD monitor without any obstacles, and I can’t see anything…<br>Of course, it turned out that I was not the worst. The worst was our boss, who was directly told by another colleague that he was here to bask in the sun… </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Install the computer, remove the anti-virus tyrant, and configure it to your usual environment.<br>Of course, the company’s internet speed is too slow… Go back and copy some large software.<br>Then, I saw sister You. Mu thought of knowing me. After chatting for a while, the entire browser department had a small meeting. </p>
<p>Alas, this sentence is too witty. Everyone is technical, so silent, I am speechless.<br>I went back to the boss and assigned a task. After a while, I saw that it was past 6 o’clock. Isn’t it off work? Because there is no movement around Shenma? Asked in the group, it turned out that everyone was struggling with getting off work.<br>I had no choice but to stand still. At 20, I saw the instructor flashed. The mentor, I had to follow his footsteps, said hello to the boss, and ran back~ </p>
<h2 id="the-next-day"><a href="#the-next-day" class="headerlink" title="the next day"></a>the next day</h2><p>Randomly divided into teams, gave the team name and slogan<br>How to sum up their opinions when first encountered<br>In the end we decided on Bubble Fish / I am Bubble Fish, I love Bubble Fish as the team name and slogan<br>(On the third day I saw a cute clown fish, I brought it to play, and took a closer look at the “bubbling fish”, stupid, such a coincidence?)<br>Poster: Y+ for UI is a cow, a few bubbling fish are painted vividly, very Q </p>
<p>The various processes are intricate and complicated. I guess the one I can use is the administration department-there is only one drawer key. </p>
<p>In the end, the imitation was too much. I feel that it is not a problem of observation, but a misunderstanding of thinking. I have read a lot of thinking books, but I still see it.<br>Or where xi is good at this kind of problem, it is the first one to get it done. </p>
<h2 id="Third-day"><a href="#Third-day" class="headerlink" title="Third day"></a>Third day</h2><p>Time is getting tighter and tighter. Yesterday there was still some free time. I ran back to configure the development environment, and it was gone today.<br>Let’s draw the SKY logo, everyone will<br>The original purpose is to let everyone know to abide by the norms </p>
<p>Then I gave some random pictures and typeset out a newspaper<br>I thought about buying Apple. Fortunately, our group didn’t start the discussion. After finding that other groups also used this, we decided to give up<br>There are some sensitive issues, Xiaodong said don’t mention it, then forget it </p>
<p>Sister Yang Yang posted 10 questions, which will be changed into a sketch to perform in the evening, and then the questions will be inserted.<br>Have a quick meal at noon and collect answers to questions<br>It didn’t take long for the afternoon training time<br>Claiming to be a brainwashing training, among which the YY video on the mobile Internet, I really want to be born a hundred years later<br>The group was assigned to perform innovatively, and we adopted Yuan’s opinion.<br>Even though Brother Yuan is a small MM, he is very open and passionate.<br>Zhao Yang is really talented as a host. He used a lot of nonsense to fill the scene during the whole process.<br>Xiaodong keeps saying that he can’t do well, but he did well on the spot<br>I’m the referee, it’s pure soy sauce~ </p>
<p>Then we only have one hour to discuss the evening sketch<br>Brother Yuan has always been a more active thinking person. Later in the process of discussion, I finally found out that I was really not a post-90s, not a brain-disabled person. </p>
<p>Until the first group came on the field, we still did not determine the final ending, this is the place to pay attention to next.<br>The overall performance of the sketch is very good, just under the middle card. </p>
<p>At this time, I saw “Don’t live in other people’s world”. I went out and drank some water. I just ran into two school recruits who had been intern for a long time. One of them had a meal, said hello, and then I sat down and had a chat. The other kept asking me about the situation in Hefei and which university.<br>Of course it is China Other University. After saying it twice, they both looked confused, which caused my confidence to drop sharply, and my oral English still failed…<br>What surprised me was that Hang Dian was also a COU (just googled, and it was not. Of course, such NB schools don’t need this stuff, which is fundamentally different from mine).<br>I said that most of our schools find jobs locally, usually about 2k or so. He curled his lips. After I thought about it, he probably forgot about the low prices in Hefei.<br>Then JS came over and learned that Baidi’s library could borrow books on Friday.<br>After playing Wii, I went back to the classroom, dizzy, is the show over… </p>
<p>After everything was over, Sister Yang Yang said…<br>…<br>Well, sure enough time is tighter. Let’s roughly talk about the distribution of marketing planning. After all, it was so late and dissolved. </p>
<p>When I arrived at the gate, I ran into Brother Yuan and told me to take the parcel. Anyway, it’s already so late, and in the mansion garden, I’ll follow along and have a look.<br>Walking with this kind of girl paper makes me feel more dangerous.<br>After walking around for a long time, she finally found Yunda Point and learned that she had been taken away by someone she knew.<br>Now what happened to me, flash. </p>
<p>The first taxi never stopped! Sister, after getting on the second car, I told the driver that the front was refused? Seeing my face was silent, he also explained the previous one for a long time, to the effect that I would stop complaining. Alas, I’m actually tired, so just put it this way, how can I make a complaint? </p>
<p>I have to do laundry when I come back. There are so many trivial things… </p>
<h2 id="Fourth-day"><a href="#Fourth-day" class="headerlink" title="Fourth day"></a>Fourth day</h2><p>Brother Hao can really say, just a few hours at a time, if my throat becomes hoarse prematurely<br>Later, I learned that I had been a lecturer and practiced before, no wonder<br>There is a thought storm, the use of iron clothes racks. The balance is not very good, you can use the score=total/10 algorithm to return to balance<br>Of course, the market is not fair. There are always monopolistic companies who have the final say. I told the group that you should not care about others too much.<br>Squatting, alas, Tai Chi only forgets this<br>Squatting is estimated to be less than two minutes, so it’s sour.<br>There is a small voice in my heart, I am an intellectual hero, who can’t recognize the position, and always try his best. If you fall, the team will be incomplete tomorrow.<br>I figured this out and jumped up immediately (I still have the strength to jump up…)<br>Before the board game in the evening, I ran into sister Yang Yang during dinner and helped her move something in the administration department.<br>Then ran to table tennis and rubbed two balls<br>The board game is a killing game, everyone plays well hi<br>Brother Yuan talks a lot, Barabara confused everyone<br>Help Y+ fix the wireless connection at night, wash and sleep </p>
<h2 id="Fifth-day"><a href="#Fifth-day" class="headerlink" title="Fifth day"></a>Fifth day</h2><p>After the training today, I carefully mentioned it to the boss, sitting and doing nothing, there is nothing to do with it.<br>The boss said immediately that Seng had already prepared the task, but he didn’t say anything.<br>(It turned out to be like this, T.T)<br>… </p>
<h2 id="Sixth-day"><a href="#Sixth-day" class="headerlink" title="Sixth day"></a>Sixth day</h2><p>West Lake Orientation<br>We set off at 6.50, and it takes about an hour and a half to get to the Broken Bridge.<br>I also met the captain on the bus, and Yanjiao was also on this bus… </p>
<p>The West Lake is too hot, the team bought some fans<br>Get the task and set off </p>
<p>The classic fragment of the legend of the new white lady, beautiful, beautiful, delicious food for foreign tourists to write “Hello, Hangzhou…” and other tasks<br>A large group of people greeted us, Yuan brother Yijia rushed up immediately<br>Well, the English is really intermittent, and I still rely on the tour guide to translate…<br>The dialogue between them can still be understood, but let me just say…<br>There was a short lady next to me, who seemed to be of the yellow race, and how old I was. She was struggling at the time, and finally finally said the first time to a foreigner for the first time and asked a comparatively 2 question “Where are you” from?”<br>US Australia or something<br>Then I don’t know what to say…It’s really dumb English… </p>
<p>The first task was blindfolded, the team stretched the 10-meter rope into a regular pentagon. </p>
<p>I started to use Xiaodong 1.78 as equal length and side length, leaving a lot of rope<br>In fact, the instructor didn’t make it clear, so there can be no more<br>Of course we all admit our own mistakes, and that neglect did not mention </p>
<p>At first I thought about measuring the angle by hand, 108.<br>Later I found that they are measuring the distance to the corners, which is more convenient and accurate </p>
<p>After we all think it is a regular pentagon, it ends<br>Before I took off the blindfold, I was still anxious. After all, I made it out of feeling.<br>After actually seeing the graphics, I took a sigh of relief. In my heart, I sighed that the cooperation is really amazing.<br>Finally we completed the first item with full marks </p>
<p>When I get to the museum, I strongly recommend going in and blowing on the air conditioner, cooldown, but some people are afraid that there is not enough time, and they may not be able to get out (囧), so everyone continues on the road </p>
<p>The second task guess the word </p>
<p>I haven’t reacted yet, Brother Yuan has already done both…<br>Ο \ _ \ _ Ο “…<br>My only contribution is: let them put the stuck one aside, continue to the next one, and finally use the elimination method to see if there is a breakthrough<br>In the end, we finished it in more than 3 minutes, but unfortunately we made two mistakes (we learned later that we have the highest correct rate and the shortest time) </p>
<p>The third task: Outsmart nuclear warheads </p>
<p>A square area with a side length of four meters, there is a cup inside. Use rope, rubber band, chopsticks, and straws to pour a bottle of water in and take out the cup. During the whole process, people cannot enter the area and ropes and other objects cannot fall to the ground. </p>
<p>My suggestion is to pierce two holes so that you only need to lift the bottle above the cup, although some water will spill out on the road<br>But they are afraid it will be slower<br>Later, I learned that the Qianjiang No. 7 group of Fanxi had used this method. Now think about it, this may be slower, but it can save time for tying the rope + pouring water.<br>Finally, we used the most traditional method, pouring water </p>
<p>Take out the cup<br>I want to wind it more, wind it in the opposite direction, and then pull it out. When I watch the video, another group of this method failed. Fortunately, they said it was unstable. Use a slip knot and rejected this plan.<br>Then I saw the captain fiddle with the chopsticks and rubber bands again, so I went over and asked him what he thought of it<br>Later, I guessed that I was seen by Brother Yuan holding the rubber band. She suddenly jumped over and yelled: “I know, I know” </p>
<p>Fold the N rubber bands together, pull them apart with four ropes, then wrap the quilt, loosen it, wait for the rubber bands to hoop the cup, lift it up slowly<br>Let’s listen! ! !<br>Then I immediately thought of some of the points to pay attention to. After all, the rubber bands have more elasticity. If the hoop cup is not matched well, the cup is more likely to fall.<br>Then it started<br>This time I am in charge of observing<br>Jepen seems to be a little nervous, the rope can’t relax, the cup shook<br>Our voices coordinated, and finally ended this last event with a full score </p>
<p>Catch the bus<br>Jepen said that the other groups have been completed and there is not enough time (without such incentives, there are still many groups that have not arrived after we went back)<br>We went back, but fortunately we didn’t go back…<br>Suddenly the bus came, and everyone rushed to the opposite side of the road (Xiaodong and I feel that life is still important, it is the slowest crossing the road)<br>The captain on the bus suddenly saw the phone number of a contact person at the last bus stop. I felt it necessary to say something, in case it was still there waiting for us.<br>After the call, I knew I had gone back… </p>
<p>your<br>I didn’t expect Sister Bobo to take the photo. It was really interesting<br>I saw myself standing there blindfolded, good 2 ah, let’s not say…<br>Yanjiao’s group used the method of squeezing a bottle to pour water into a cup two meters away in “Smart Nuclear Warhead”, and later wanted to climb trees<br>Some want to tie people up and hang them<br>Too NB </p>
<p>At last<br>I have no feeling for the ranking, as long as it is not the last<br>Of course we won the first place without a doubt<br>Go to grandma’s house in the evening, the first group meeting of the group, so happy<br>I saw Brother Yuan’s room paper </p>
<p>Thoughts<br>I have always been alone in the university. Although I know that teamwork is very important, I have never felt it. Last year’s interview said that the team was unfounded. In this training, I personally experienced the magic of teamwork, it’s really amazing… </p>
<p>The FEEL training is about to end. Although I’m tired every day, I really appreciate everyone of Bubble Fish, O(∩_∩)O Thank you </p>
